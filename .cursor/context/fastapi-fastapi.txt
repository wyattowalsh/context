# Alternatives, Inspiration and Comparisons

What inspired **FastAPI**, how it compares to alternatives and what it learned from them.

## Intro

**FastAPI** wouldn't exist if not for the previous work of others.

There have been many tools created before that have helped inspire its creation.

I have been avoiding the creation of a new framework for several years. First I tried to solve all the features covered by **FastAPI** using many different frameworks, plug-ins, and tools.

But at some point, there was no other option than creating something that provided all these features, taking the best ideas from previous tools, and combining them in the best way possible, using language features that weren't even available before (Python 3.6+ type hints).

## Previous tools

### <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Django</a>

It's the most popular Python framework and is widely trusted. It is used to build systems like Instagram.

It's relatively tightly coupled with relational databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL), so, having a NoSQL database (like Couchbase, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc) as the main store engine is not very easy.

It was created to generate the HTML in the backend, not to create APIs used by a modern frontend (like React, Vue.js and Angular) or by other systems (like <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> devices) communicating with it.

### <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Django REST Framework</a>

Django REST framework was created to be a flexible toolkit for building Web APIs using Django underneath, to improve its API capabilities.

It is used by many companies including Mozilla, Red Hat and Eventbrite.

It was one of the first examples of **automatic API documentation**, and this was specifically one of the first ideas that inspired "the search for" **FastAPI**.

/// note

Django REST Framework was created by Tom Christie. The same creator of Starlette and Uvicorn, on which **FastAPI** is based.

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Have an automatic API documentation web user interface.

///

### <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com" class="external-link" target="_blank">Flask</a>

Flask is a "microframework", it doesn't include database integrations nor many of the things that come by default in Django.

This simplicity and flexibility allow doing things like using NoSQL databases as the main data storage system.

As it is very simple, it's relatively intuitive to learn, although the documentation gets somewhat technical at some points.

It is also commonly used for other applications that don't necessarily need a database, user management, or any of the many features that come pre-built in Django. Although many of these features can be added with plug-ins.

This decoupling of parts, and being a "microframework" that could be extended to cover exactly what is needed was a key feature that I wanted to keep.

Given the simplicity of Flask, it seemed like a good match for building APIs. The next thing to find was a "Django REST Framework" for Flask.

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Be a micro-framework. Making it easy to mix and match the tools and parts needed.

Have a simple and easy to use routing system.

///

### <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io" class="external-link" target="_blank">Requests</a>

**FastAPI** is not actually an alternative to **Requests**. Their scope is very different.

It would actually be common to use Requests *inside* of a FastAPI application.

But still, FastAPI got quite some inspiration from Requests.

**Requests** is a library to *interact* with APIs (as a client), while **FastAPI** is a library to *build* APIs (as a server).

They are, more or less, at opposite ends, complementing each other.

Requests has a very simple and intuitive design, it's very easy to use, with sensible defaults. But at the same time, it's very powerful and customizable.

That's why, as said in the official website:

> Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages of all time

The way you use it is very simple. For example, to do a `GET` request, you would write:

```Python
response = requests.get("http://example.com/some/url")
```

The FastAPI counterpart API *path operation* could look like:

```Python hl_lines="1"
@app.get("/some/url")
def read_url():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

See the similarities in `requests.get(...)` and `@app.get(...)`.

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

* Have a simple and intuitive API.
* Use HTTP method names (operations) directly, in a straightforward and intuitive way.
* Have sensible defaults, but powerful customizations.

///

### <a href="https://swagger.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Swagger</a> / <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a>

The main feature I wanted from Django REST Framework was the automatic API documentation.

Then I found that there was a standard to document APIs, using JSON (or YAML, an extension of JSON) called Swagger.

And there was a web user interface for Swagger APIs already created. So, being able to generate Swagger documentation for an API would allow using this web user interface automatically.

At some point, Swagger was given to the Linux Foundation, to be renamed OpenAPI.

That's why when talking about version 2.0 it's common to say "Swagger", and for version 3+ "OpenAPI".

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Adopt and use an open standard for API specifications, instead of a custom schema.

And integrate standards-based user interface tools:

* <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui" class="external-link" target="_blank">Swagger UI</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">ReDoc</a>

These two were chosen for being fairly popular and stable, but doing a quick search, you could find dozens of alternative user interfaces for OpenAPI (that you can use with **FastAPI**).

///

### Flask REST frameworks

There are several Flask REST frameworks, but after investing the time and work into investigating them, I found that many are discontinued or abandoned, with several standing issues that made them unfit.

### <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Marshmallow</a>

One of the main features needed by API systems is data "<abbr title="also called marshalling, conversion">serialization</abbr>" which is taking data from the code (Python) and converting it into something that can be sent through the network. For example, converting an object containing data from a database into a JSON object. Converting `datetime` objects into strings, etc.

Another big feature needed by APIs is data validation, making sure that the data is valid, given certain parameters. For example, that some field is an `int`, and not some random string. This is especially useful for incoming data.

Without a data validation system, you would have to do all the checks by hand, in code.

These features are what Marshmallow was built to provide. It is a great library, and I have used it a lot before.

But it was created before there existed Python type hints. So, to define every <abbr title="the definition of how data should be formed">schema</abbr> you need to use specific utils and classes provided by Marshmallow.

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Use code to define "schemas" that provide data types and validation, automatically.

///

### <a href="https://webargs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Webargs</a>

Another big feature required by APIs is <abbr title="reading and converting to Python data">parsing</abbr> data from incoming requests.

Webargs is a tool that was made to provide that on top of several frameworks, including Flask.

It uses Marshmallow underneath to do the data validation. And it was created by the same developers.

It's a great tool and I have used it a lot too, before having **FastAPI**.

/// info

Webargs was created by the same Marshmallow developers.

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Have automatic validation of incoming request data.

///

### <a href="https://apispec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">APISpec</a>

Marshmallow and Webargs provide validation, parsing and serialization as plug-ins.

But documentation is still missing. Then APISpec was created.

It is a plug-in for many frameworks (and there's a plug-in for Starlette too).

The way it works is that you write the definition of the schema using YAML format inside the docstring of each function handling a route.

And it generates OpenAPI schemas.

That's how it works in Flask, Starlette, Responder, etc.

But then, we have again the problem of having a micro-syntax, inside of a Python string (a big YAML).

The editor can't help much with that. And if we modify parameters or Marshmallow schemas and forget to also modify that YAML docstring, the generated schema would be obsolete.

/// info

APISpec was created by the same Marshmallow developers.

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Support the open standard for APIs, OpenAPI.

///

### <a href="https://flask-apispec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Flask-apispec</a>

It's a Flask plug-in, that ties together Webargs, Marshmallow and APISpec.

It uses the information from Webargs and Marshmallow to automatically generate OpenAPI schemas, using APISpec.

It's a great tool, very underrated. It should be way more popular than many Flask plug-ins out there. It might be due to its documentation being too concise and abstract.

This solved having to write YAML (another syntax) inside of Python docstrings.

This combination of Flask, Flask-apispec with Marshmallow and Webargs was my favorite backend stack until building **FastAPI**.

Using it led to the creation of several Flask full-stack generators. These are the main stacks I (and several external teams) have been using up to now:

* <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-flask-couchbase" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-flask-couchbase</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-flask-couchdb" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-flask-couchdb</a>

And these same full-stack generators were the base of the [**FastAPI** Project Generators](project-generation.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

/// info

Flask-apispec was created by the same Marshmallow developers.

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Generate the OpenAPI schema automatically, from the same code that defines serialization and validation.

///

### <a href="https://nestjs.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">NestJS</a> (and <a href="https://angular.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Angular</a>)

This isn't even Python, NestJS is a JavaScript (TypeScript) NodeJS framework inspired by Angular.

It achieves something somewhat similar to what can be done with Flask-apispec.

It has an integrated dependency injection system, inspired by Angular 2. It requires pre-registering the "injectables" (like all the other dependency injection systems I know), so, it adds to the verbosity and code repetition.

As the parameters are described with TypeScript types (similar to Python type hints), editor support is quite good.

But as TypeScript data is not preserved after compilation to JavaScript, it cannot rely on the types to define validation, serialization and documentation at the same time. Due to this and some design decisions, to get validation, serialization and automatic schema generation, it's needed to add decorators in many places. So, it becomes quite verbose.

It can't handle nested models very well. So, if the JSON body in the request is a JSON object that has inner fields that in turn are nested JSON objects, it cannot be properly documented and validated.

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Use Python types to have great editor support.

Have a powerful dependency injection system. Find a way to minimize code repetition.

///

### <a href="https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Sanic</a>

It was one of the first extremely fast Python frameworks based on `asyncio`. It was made to be very similar to Flask.

/// note | Technical Details

It used <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uvloop`</a> instead of the default Python `asyncio` loop. That's what made it so fast.

It clearly inspired Uvicorn and Starlette, that are currently faster than Sanic in open benchmarks.

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Find a way to have a crazy performance.

That's why **FastAPI** is based on Starlette, as it is the fastest framework available (tested by third-party benchmarks).

///

### <a href="https://falconframework.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Falcon</a>

Falcon is another high performance Python framework, it is designed to be minimal, and work as the foundation of other frameworks like Hug.

It is designed to have functions that receive two parameters, one "request" and one "response". Then you "read" parts from the request, and "write" parts to the response. Because of this design, it is not possible to declare request parameters and bodies with standard Python type hints as function parameters.

So, data validation, serialization, and documentation, have to be done in code, not automatically. Or they have to be implemented as a framework on top of Falcon, like Hug. This same distinction happens in other frameworks that are inspired by Falcon's design, of having one request object and one response object as parameters.

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Find ways to get great performance.

Along with Hug (as Hug is based on Falcon) inspired **FastAPI** to declare a `response` parameter in functions.

Although in FastAPI it's optional, and is used mainly to set headers, cookies, and alternative status codes.

///

### <a href="https://moltenframework.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Molten</a>

I discovered Molten in the first stages of building **FastAPI**. And it has quite similar ideas:

* Based on Python type hints.
* Validation and documentation from these types.
* Dependency Injection system.

It doesn't use a data validation, serialization and documentation third-party library like Pydantic, it has its own. So, these data type definitions would not be reusable as easily.

It requires a little bit more verbose configurations. And as it is based on WSGI (instead of ASGI), it is not designed to take advantage of the high performance provided by tools like Uvicorn, Starlette and Sanic.

The dependency injection system requires pre-registration of the dependencies and the dependencies are solved based on the declared types. So, it's not possible to declare more than one "component" that provides a certain type.

Routes are declared in a single place, using functions declared in other places (instead of using decorators that can be placed right on top of the function that handles the endpoint). This is closer to how Django does it than to how Flask (and Starlette) does it. It separates in the code things that are relatively tightly coupled.

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Define extra validations for data types using the "default" value of model attributes. This improves editor support, and it was not available in Pydantic before.

This actually inspired updating parts of Pydantic, to support the same validation declaration style (all this functionality is now already available in Pydantic).

///

### <a href="https://github.com/hugapi/hug" class="external-link" target="_blank">Hug</a>

Hug was one of the first frameworks to implement the declaration of API parameter types using Python type hints. This was a great idea that inspired other tools to do the same.

It used custom types in its declarations instead of standard Python types, but it was still a huge step forward.

It also was one of the first frameworks to generate a custom schema declaring the whole API in JSON.

It was not based on a standard like OpenAPI and JSON Schema. So it wouldn't be straightforward to integrate it with other tools, like Swagger UI. But again, it was a very innovative idea.

It has an interesting, uncommon feature: using the same framework, it's possible to create APIs and also CLIs.

As it is based on the previous standard for synchronous Python web frameworks (WSGI), it can't handle Websockets and other things, although it still has high performance too.

/// info

Hug was created by Timothy Crosley, the same creator of <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort" class="external-link" target="_blank">`isort`</a>, a great tool to automatically sort imports in Python files.

///

/// check | Ideas inspiring **FastAPI**

Hug inspired parts of APIStar, and was one of the tools I found most promising, alongside APIStar.

Hug helped inspiring **FastAPI** to use Python type hints to declare parameters, and to generate a schema defining the API automatically.

Hug inspired **FastAPI** to declare a `response` parameter in functions to set headers and cookies.

///

### <a href="https://github.com/encode/apistar" class="external-link" target="_blank">APIStar</a> (<= 0.5)

Right before deciding to build **FastAPI** I found **APIStar** server. It had almost everything I was looking for and had a great design.

It was one of the first implementations of a framework using Python type hints to declare parameters and requests that I ever saw (before NestJS and Molten). I found it more or less at the same time as Hug. But APIStar used the OpenAPI standard.

It had automatic data validation, data serialization and OpenAPI schema generation based on the same type hints in several places.

Body schema definitions didn't use the same Python type hints like Pydantic, it was a bit more similar to Marshmallow, so, editor support wouldn't be as good, but still, APIStar was the best available option.

It had the best performance benchmarks at the time (only surpassed by Starlette).

At first, it didn't have an automatic API documentation web UI, but I knew I could add Swagger UI to it.

It had a dependency injection system. It required pre-registration of components, as other tools discussed above. But still, it was a great feature.

I was never able to use it in a full project, as it didn't have security integration, so, I couldn't replace all the features I was having with the full-stack generators based on Flask-apispec. I had in my backlog of projects to create a pull request adding that functionality.

But then, the project's focus shifted.

It was no longer an API web framework, as the creator needed to focus on Starlette.

Now APIStar is a set of tools to validate OpenAPI specifications, not a web framework.

/// info

APIStar was created by Tom Christie. The same guy that created:

* Django REST Framework
* Starlette (in which **FastAPI** is based)
* Uvicorn (used by Starlette and **FastAPI**)

///

/// check | Inspired **FastAPI** to

Exist.

The idea of declaring multiple things (data validation, serialization and documentation) with the same Python types, that at the same time provided great editor support, was something I considered a brilliant idea.

And after searching for a long time for a similar framework and testing many different alternatives, APIStar was the best option available.

Then APIStar stopped to exist as a server and Starlette was created, and was a new better foundation for such a system. That was the final inspiration to build **FastAPI**.

I consider **FastAPI** a "spiritual successor" to APIStar, while improving and increasing the features, typing system, and other parts, based on the learnings from all these previous tools.

///

## Used by **FastAPI**

### <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic</a>

Pydantic is a library to define data validation, serialization and documentation (using JSON Schema) based on Python type hints.

That makes it extremely intuitive.

It is comparable to Marshmallow. Although it's faster than Marshmallow in benchmarks. And as it is based on the same Python type hints, the editor support is great.

/// check | **FastAPI** uses it to

Handle all the data validation, data serialization and automatic model documentation (based on JSON Schema).

**FastAPI** then takes that JSON Schema data and puts it in OpenAPI, apart from all the other things it does.

///

### <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette</a>

Starlette is a lightweight <abbr title="The new standard for building asynchronous Python web applications">ASGI</abbr> framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high-performance asyncio services.

It is very simple and intuitive. It's designed to be easily extensible, and have modular components.

It has:

* Seriously impressive performance.
* WebSocket support.
* In-process background tasks.
* Startup and shutdown events.
* Test client built on HTTPX.
* CORS, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses.
* Session and Cookie support.
* 100% test coverage.
* 100% type annotated codebase.
* Few hard dependencies.

Starlette is currently the fastest Python framework tested. Only surpassed by Uvicorn, which is not a framework, but a server.

Starlette provides all the basic web microframework functionality.

But it doesn't provide automatic data validation, serialization or documentation.

That's one of the main things that **FastAPI** adds on top, all based on Python type hints (using Pydantic). That, plus the dependency injection system, security utilities, OpenAPI schema generation, etc.

/// note | Technical Details

ASGI is a new "standard" being developed by Django core team members. It is still not a "Python standard" (a PEP), although they are in the process of doing that.

Nevertheless, it is already being used as a "standard" by several tools. This greatly improves interoperability, as you could switch Uvicorn for any other ASGI server (like Daphne or Hypercorn), or you could add ASGI compatible tools, like `python-socketio`.

///

/// check | **FastAPI** uses it to

Handle all the core web parts. Adding features on top.

The class `FastAPI` itself inherits directly from the class `Starlette`.

So, anything that you can do with Starlette, you can do it directly with **FastAPI**, as it is basically Starlette on steroids.

///

### <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Uvicorn</a>

Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server, built on uvloop and httptools.

It is not a web framework, but a server. For example, it doesn't provide tools for routing by paths. That's something that a framework like Starlette (or **FastAPI**) would provide on top.

It is the recommended server for Starlette and **FastAPI**.

/// check | **FastAPI** recommends it as

The main web server to run **FastAPI** applications.

You can also use the `--workers` command line option to have an asynchronous multi-process server.

Check more details in the [Deployment](deployment/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank} section.

///

## Benchmarks and speed

================================================
FILE: docs/en/docs/async.md
================================================
# Concurrency and async / await

Details about the `async def` syntax for *path operation functions* and some background about asynchronous code, concurrency, and parallelism.

## In a hurry?

<abbr title="too long; didn't read"><strong>TL;DR:</strong></abbr>

If you are using third party libraries that tell you to call them with `await`, like:

```Python
results = await some_library()
```

Then, declare your *path operation functions* with `async def` like:

```Python hl_lines="2"
@app.get('/')
async def read_results():
    results = await some_library()
    return results
```

/// note

You can only use `await` inside of functions created with `async def`.

///

---

If you are using a third party library that communicates with something (a database, an API, the file system, etc.) and doesn't have support for using `await`, (this is currently the case for most database libraries), then declare your *path operation functions* as normally, with just `def`, like:

```Python hl_lines="2"
@app.get('/')
def results():
    results = some_library()
    return results
```

---

If your application (somehow) doesn't have to communicate with anything else and wait for it to respond, use `async def`.

---

If you just don't know, use normal `def`.

---

**Note**: You can mix `def` and `async def` in your *path operation functions* as much as you need and define each one using the best option for you. FastAPI will do the right thing with them.

Anyway, in any of the cases above, FastAPI will still work asynchronously and be extremely fast.

But by following the steps above, it will be able to do some performance optimizations.

## Technical Details

Modern versions of Python have support for **"asynchronous code"** using something called **"coroutines"**, with **`async` and `await`** syntax.

Let's see that phrase by parts in the sections below:

* **Asynchronous Code**
* **`async` and `await`**
* **Coroutines**

## Asynchronous Code

Asynchronous code just means that the language 💬 has a way to tell the computer / program 🤖 that at some point in the code, it 🤖 will have to wait for *something else* to finish somewhere else. Let's say that *something else* is called "slow-file" 📝.

So, during that time, the computer can go and do some other work, while "slow-file" 📝 finishes.

Then the computer / program 🤖 will come back every time it has a chance because it's waiting again, or whenever it 🤖 finished all the work it had at that point. And it 🤖 will see if any of the tasks it was waiting for have already finished, doing whatever it had to do.

Next, it 🤖 takes the first task to finish (let's say, our "slow-file" 📝) and continues whatever it had to do with it.

That "wait for something else" normally refers to <abbr title="Input and Output">I/O</abbr> operations that are relatively "slow" (compared to the speed of the processor and the RAM memory), like waiting for:

* the data from the client to be sent through the network
* the data sent by your program to be received by the client through the network
* the contents of a file in the disk to be read by the system and given to your program
* the contents your program gave to the system to be written to disk
* a remote API operation
* a database operation to finish
* a database query to return the results
* etc.

As the execution time is consumed mostly by waiting for <abbr title="Input and Output">I/O</abbr> operations, they call them "I/O bound" operations.

It's called "asynchronous" because the computer / program doesn't have to be "synchronized" with the slow task, waiting for the exact moment that the task finishes, while doing nothing, to be able to take the task result and continue the work.

Instead of that, by being an "asynchronous" system, once finished, the task can wait in line a little bit (some microseconds) for the computer / program to finish whatever it went to do, and then come back to take the results and continue working with them.

For "synchronous" (contrary to "asynchronous") they commonly also use the term "sequential", because the computer / program follows all the steps in sequence before switching to a different task, even if those steps involve waiting.

### Concurrency and Burgers

This idea of **asynchronous** code described above is also sometimes called **"concurrency"**. It is different from **"parallelism"**.

**Concurrency** and **parallelism** both relate to "different things happening more or less at the same time".

But the details between *concurrency* and *parallelism* are quite different.

To see the difference, imagine the following story about burgers:

### Concurrent Burgers

You go with your crush to get fast food, you stand in line while the cashier takes the orders from the people in front of you. 😍

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-01.png" class="illustration">

Then it's your turn, you place your order of 2 very fancy burgers for your crush and you. 🍔🍔

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-02.png" class="illustration">

The cashier says something to the cook in the kitchen so they know they have to prepare your burgers (even though they are currently preparing the ones for the previous clients).

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-03.png" class="illustration">

You pay. 💸

The cashier gives you the number of your turn.

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-04.png" class="illustration">

While you are waiting, you go with your crush and pick a table, you sit and talk with your crush for a long time (as your burgers are very fancy and take some time to prepare).

As you are sitting at the table with your crush, while you wait for the burgers, you can spend that time admiring how awesome, cute and smart your crush is ✨😍✨.

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-05.png" class="illustration">

While waiting and talking to your crush, from time to time, you check the number displayed on the counter to see if it's your turn already.

Then at some point, it finally is your turn. You go to the counter, get your burgers and come back to the table.

<img src="/img/async/concurrent-burgers/concurrent-burgers-06.png" class="illustration">

You and your crush eat the burgers and have a nice time. ✨

---

Imagine you are the computer / program 🤖 in that story.

While you are at the line, you are just idle 😴, waiting for your turn, not doing anything very "productive". But the line is fast because the cashier is only taking the orders (not preparing them), so that's fine.

Then, when it's your turn, you do actual "productive" work, you process the menu, decide what you want, get your crush's choice, pay, check that you give the correct bill or card, check that you are charged correctly, check that the order has the correct items, etc.

But then, even though you still don't have your burgers, your work with the cashier is "on pause" ⏸, because you have to wait 🕙 for your burgers to be ready.

But as you go away from the counter and sit at the table with a number for your turn, you can switch 🔀 your attention to your crush, and "work" ⏯ 🤓 on that. Then you are again doing something very "productive" as is flirting with your crush 😍.

Then the cashier 💁 says "I'm finished with doing the burgers" by putting your number on the counter's display, but you don't jump like crazy immediately when the displayed number changes to your turn number. You know no one will steal your burgers because you have the number of your turn, and they have theirs.

So you wait for your crush to finish the story (finish the current work ⏯ / task being processed 🤓), smile gently and say that you are going for the burgers ⏸.

Then you go to the counter 🔀, to the initial task that is now finished ⏯, pick the burgers, say thanks and take them to the table. That finishes that step / task of interaction with the counter ⏹. That in turn, creates a new task, of "eating burgers" 🔀 ⏯, but the previous one of "getting burgers" is finished ⏹.

### Parallel Burgers

Now let's imagine these aren't "Concurrent Burgers", but "Parallel Burgers".

You go with your crush to get parallel fast food.

You stand in line while several (let's say 8) cashiers that at the same time are cooks take the orders from the people in front of you.

Everyone before you is waiting for their burgers to be ready before leaving the counter because each of the 8 cashiers goes and prepares the burger right away before getting the next order.

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-01.png" class="illustration">

Then it's finally your turn, you place your order of 2 very fancy burgers for your crush and you.

You pay 💸.

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-02.png" class="illustration">

The cashier goes to the kitchen.

You wait, standing in front of the counter 🕙, so that no one else takes your burgers before you do, as there are no numbers for turns.

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-03.png" class="illustration">

As you and your crush are busy not letting anyone get in front of you and take your burgers whenever they arrive, you cannot pay attention to your crush. 😞

This is "synchronous" work, you are "synchronized" with the cashier/cook 👨‍🍳. You have to wait 🕙 and be there at the exact moment that the cashier/cook 👨‍🍳 finishes the burgers and gives them to you, or otherwise, someone else might take them.

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-04.png" class="illustration">

Then your cashier/cook 👨‍🍳 finally comes back with your burgers, after a long time waiting 🕙 there in front of the counter.

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-05.png" class="illustration">

You take your burgers and go to the table with your crush.

You just eat them, and you are done. ⏹

<img src="/img/async/parallel-burgers/parallel-burgers-06.png" class="illustration">

There was not much talk or flirting as most of the time was spent waiting 🕙 in front of the counter. 😞

---

In this scenario of the parallel burgers, you are a computer / program 🤖 with two processors (you and your crush), both waiting 🕙 and dedicating their attention ⏯ to be "waiting on the counter" 🕙 for a long time.

The fast food store has 8 processors (cashiers/cooks). While the concurrent burgers store might have had only 2 (one cashier and one cook).

But still, the final experience is not the best. 😞

---

This would be the parallel equivalent story for burgers. 🍔

For a more "real life" example of this, imagine a bank.

Up to recently, most of the banks had multiple cashiers 👨‍💼👨‍💼👨‍💼👨‍💼 and a big line 🕙🕙🕙🕙🕙🕙🕙🕙.

All of the cashiers doing all the work with one client after the other 👨‍💼⏯.

And you have to wait 🕙 in the line for a long time or you lose your turn.

You probably wouldn't want to take your crush 😍 with you to run errands at the bank 🏦.

### Burger Conclusion

In this scenario of "fast food burgers with your crush", as there is a lot of waiting 🕙, it makes a lot more sense to have a concurrent system ⏸🔀⏯.

This is the case for most of the web applications.

Many, many users, but your server is waiting 🕙 for their not-so-good connection to send their requests.

And then waiting 🕙 again for the responses to come back.

This "waiting" 🕙 is measured in microseconds, but still, summing it all, it's a lot of waiting in the end.

That's why it makes a lot of sense to use asynchronous ⏸🔀⏯ code for web APIs.

This kind of asynchronicity is what made NodeJS popular (even though NodeJS is not parallel) and that's the strength of Go as a programming language.

And that's the same level of performance you get with **FastAPI**.

And as you can have parallelism and asynchronicity at the same time, you get higher performance than most of the tested NodeJS frameworks and on par with Go, which is a compiled language closer to C <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17&hw=ph&test=query&l=zijmkf-1" class="external-link" target="_blank">(all thanks to Starlette)</a>.

### Is concurrency better than parallelism?

Nope! That's not the moral of the story.

Concurrency is different than parallelism. And it is better on **specific** scenarios that involve a lot of waiting. Because of that, it generally is a lot better than parallelism for web application development. But not for everything.

So, to balance that out, imagine the following short story:

> You have to clean a big, dirty house.

*Yep, that's the whole story*.

---

There's no waiting 🕙 anywhere, just a lot of work to be done, on multiple places of the house.

You could have turns as in the burgers example, first the living room, then the kitchen, but as you are not waiting 🕙 for anything, just cleaning and cleaning, the turns wouldn't affect anything.

It would take the same amount of time to finish with or without turns (concurrency) and you would have done the same amount of work.

But in this case, if you could bring the 8 ex-cashier/cooks/now-cleaners, and each one of them (plus you) could take a zone of the house to clean it, you could do all the work in **parallel**, with the extra help, and finish much sooner.

In this scenario, each one of the cleaners (including you) would be a processor, doing their part of the job.

And as most of the execution time is taken by actual work (instead of waiting), and the work in a computer is done by a <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>, they call these problems "CPU bound".

---

Common examples of CPU bound operations are things that require complex math processing.

For example:

* **Audio** or **image processing**.
* **Computer vision**: an image is composed of millions of pixels, each pixel has 3 values / colors, processing that normally requires computing something on those pixels, all at the same time.
* **Machine Learning**: it normally requires lots of "matrix" and "vector" multiplications. Think of a huge spreadsheet with numbers and multiplying all of them together at the same time.
* **Deep Learning**: this is a sub-field of Machine Learning, so, the same applies. It's just that there is not a single spreadsheet of numbers to multiply, but a huge set of them, and in many cases, you use a special processor to build and / or use those models.

### Concurrency + Parallelism: Web + Machine Learning

With **FastAPI** you can take advantage of concurrency that is very common for web development (the same main attraction of NodeJS).

But you can also exploit the benefits of parallelism and multiprocessing (having multiple processes running in parallel) for **CPU bound** workloads like those in Machine Learning systems.

That, plus the simple fact that Python is the main language for **Data Science**, Machine Learning and especially Deep Learning, make FastAPI a very good match for Data Science / Machine Learning web APIs and applications (among many others).

To see how to achieve this parallelism in production see the section about [Deployment](deployment/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## `async` and `await`

Modern versions of Python have a very intuitive way to define asynchronous code. This makes it look just like normal "sequential" code and do the "awaiting" for you at the right moments.

When there is an operation that will require waiting before giving the results and has support for these new Python features, you can code it like:

```Python
burgers = await get_burgers(2)
```

The key here is the `await`. It tells Python that it has to wait ⏸ for `get_burgers(2)` to finish doing its thing 🕙 before storing the results in `burgers`. With that, Python will know that it can go and do something else 🔀 ⏯ in the meanwhile (like receiving another request).

For `await` to work, it has to be inside a function that supports this asynchronicity. To do that, you just declare it with `async def`:

```Python hl_lines="1"
async def get_burgers(number: int):
    # Do some asynchronous stuff to create the burgers
    return burgers
```

...instead of `def`:

```Python hl_lines="2"
# This is not asynchronous
def get_sequential_burgers(number: int):
    # Do some sequential stuff to create the burgers
    return burgers
```

With `async def`, Python knows that, inside that function, it has to be aware of `await` expressions, and that it can "pause" ⏸ the execution of that function and go do something else 🔀 before coming back.

When you want to call an `async def` function, you have to "await" it. So, this won't work:

```Python
# This won't work, because get_burgers was defined with: async def
burgers = get_burgers(2)
```

---

So, if you are using a library that tells you that you can call it with `await`, you need to create the *path operation functions* that uses it with `async def`, like in:

```Python hl_lines="2-3"
@app.get('/burgers')
async def read_burgers():
    burgers = await get_burgers(2)
    return burgers
```

### More technical details

You might have noticed that `await` can only be used inside of functions defined with `async def`.

But at the same time, functions defined with `async def` have to be "awaited". So, functions with `async def` can only be called inside of functions defined with `async def` too.

So, about the egg and the chicken, how do you call the first `async` function?

If you are working with **FastAPI** you don't have to worry about that, because that "first" function will be your *path operation function*, and FastAPI will know how to do the right thing.

But if you want to use `async` / `await` without FastAPI, you can do it as well.

### Write your own async code

Starlette (and **FastAPI**) are based on <a href="https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">AnyIO</a>, which makes it compatible with both Python's standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">asyncio</a> and <a href="https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Trio</a>.

In particular, you can directly use <a href="https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">AnyIO</a> for your advanced concurrency use cases that require more advanced patterns in your own code.

And even if you were not using FastAPI, you could also write your own async applications with <a href="https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">AnyIO</a> to be highly compatible and get its benefits (e.g. *structured concurrency*).

I created another library on top of AnyIO, as a thin layer on top, to improve a bit the type annotations and get better **autocompletion**, **inline errors**, etc. It also has a friendly introduction and tutorial to help you **understand** and write **your own async code**: <a href="https://asyncer.tiangolo.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Asyncer</a>. It would be particularly useful if you need to **combine async code with regular** (blocking/synchronous) code.

### Other forms of asynchronous code

This style of using `async` and `await` is relatively new in the language.

But it makes working with asynchronous code a lot easier.

This same syntax (or almost identical) was also included recently in modern versions of JavaScript (in Browser and NodeJS).

But before that, handling asynchronous code was quite more complex and difficult.

In previous versions of Python, you could have used threads or <a href="https://www.gevent.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Gevent</a>. But the code is way more complex to understand, debug, and think about.

In previous versions of NodeJS / Browser JavaScript, you would have used "callbacks". Which leads to <a href="http://callbackhell.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">callback hell</a>.

## Coroutines

**Coroutine** is just the very fancy term for the thing returned by an `async def` function. Python knows that it is something like a function, that it can start and that it will end at some point, but that it might be paused ⏸ internally too, whenever there is an `await` inside of it.

But all this functionality of using asynchronous code with `async` and `await` is many times summarized as using "coroutines". It is comparable to the main key feature of Go, the "Goroutines".

## Conclusion

Let's see the same phrase from above:

> Modern versions of Python have support for **"asynchronous code"** using something called **"coroutines"**, with **`async` and `await`** syntax.

That should make more sense now. ✨

All that is what powers FastAPI (through Starlette) and what makes it have such an impressive performance.

## Very Technical Details

/// warning

You can probably skip this.

These are very technical details of how **FastAPI** works underneath.

If you have quite some technical knowledge (coroutines, threads, blocking, etc.) and are curious about how FastAPI handles `async def` vs normal `def`, go ahead.

///

### Path operation functions

When you declare a *path operation function* with normal `def` instead of `async def`, it is run in an external threadpool that is then awaited, instead of being called directly (as it would block the server).

If you are coming from another async framework that does not work in the way described above and you are used to defining trivial compute-only *path operation functions* with plain `def` for a tiny performance gain (about 100 nanoseconds), please note that in **FastAPI** the effect would be quite opposite. In these cases, it's better to use `async def` unless your *path operation functions* use code that performs blocking <abbr title="Input/Output: disk reading or writing, network communications.">I/O</abbr>.

Still, in both situations, chances are that **FastAPI** will [still be faster](index.md#performance){.internal-link target=_blank} than (or at least comparable to) your previous framework.

### Dependencies

The same applies for [dependencies](tutorial/dependencies/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}. If a dependency is a standard `def` function instead of `async def`, it is run in the external threadpool.

### Sub-dependencies

You can have multiple dependencies and [sub-dependencies](tutorial/dependencies/sub-dependencies.md){.internal-link target=_blank} requiring each other (as parameters of the function definitions), some of them might be created with `async def` and some with normal `def`. It would still work, and the ones created with normal `def` would be called on an external thread (from the threadpool) instead of being "awaited".

### Other utility functions

Any other utility function that you call directly can be created with normal `def` or `async def` and FastAPI won't affect the way you call it.

This is in contrast to the functions that FastAPI calls for you: *path operation functions* and dependencies.

If your utility function is a normal function with `def`, it will be called directly (as you write it in your code), not in a threadpool, if the function is created with `async def` then you should `await` for that function when you call it in your code.

---

Again, these are very technical details that would probably be useful if you came searching for them.

Otherwise, you should be good with the guidelines from the section above: <a href="#in-a-hurry">In a hurry?</a>.

# Benchmarks

Independent TechEmpower benchmarks show **FastAPI** applications running under Uvicorn as <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&runid=7464e520-0dc2-473d-bd34-dbdfd7e85911&hw=ph&test=query&l=zijzen-7" class="external-link" target="_blank">one of the fastest Python frameworks available</a>, only below Starlette and Uvicorn themselves (used internally by FastAPI).

But when checking benchmarks and comparisons you should keep the following in mind.

## Benchmarks and speed

When you check the benchmarks, it is common to see several tools of different types compared as equivalent.

Specifically, to see Uvicorn, Starlette and FastAPI compared together (among many other tools).

The simpler the problem solved by the tool, the better performance it will get. And most of the benchmarks don't test the additional features provided by the tool.

The hierarchy is like:

* **Uvicorn**: an ASGI server
    * **Starlette**: (uses Uvicorn) a web microframework
        * **FastAPI**: (uses Starlette) an API microframework with several additional features for building APIs, with data validation, etc.

* **Uvicorn**:
    * Will have the best performance, as it doesn't have much extra code apart from the server itself.
    * You wouldn't write an application in Uvicorn directly. That would mean that your code would have to include more or less, at least, all the code provided by Starlette (or **FastAPI**). And if you did that, your final application would have the same overhead as having used a framework and minimizing your app code and bugs.
    * If you are comparing Uvicorn, compare it against Daphne, Hypercorn, uWSGI, etc. Application servers.
* **Starlette**:
    * Will have the next best performance, after Uvicorn. In fact, Starlette uses Uvicorn to run. So, it probably can only get "slower" than Uvicorn by having to execute more code.
    * But it provides you the tools to build simple web applications, with routing based on paths, etc.
    * If you are comparing Starlette, compare it against Sanic, Flask, Django, etc. Web frameworks (or microframeworks).
* **FastAPI**:
    * The same way that Starlette uses Uvicorn and cannot be faster than it, **FastAPI** uses Starlette, so it cannot be faster than it.
    * FastAPI provides more features on top of Starlette. Features that you almost always need when building APIs, like data validation and serialization. And by using it, you get automatic documentation for free (the automatic documentation doesn't even add overhead to running applications, it is generated on startup).
    * If you didn't use FastAPI and used Starlette directly (or another tool, like Sanic, Flask, Responder, etc) you would have to implement all the data validation and serialization yourself. So, your final application would still have the same overhead as if it was built using FastAPI. And in many cases, this data validation and serialization is the biggest amount of code written in applications.
    * So, by using FastAPI you are saving development time, bugs, lines of code, and you would probably get the same performance (or better) you would if you didn't use it (as you would have to implement it all in your code).
    * If you are comparing FastAPI, compare it against a web application framework (or set of tools) that provides data validation, serialization and documentation, like Flask-apispec, NestJS, Molten, etc. Frameworks with integrated automatic data validation, serialization and documentation.

================================================
# Development - Contributing

First, you might want to see the basic ways to [help FastAPI and get help](help-fastapi.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## Developing

If you already cloned the <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi" class="external-link" target="_blank">fastapi repository</a> and you want to deep dive in the code, here are some guidelines to set up your environment.

### Virtual environment

Follow the instructions to create and activate a [virtual environment](virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank} for the internal code of `fastapi`.

### Install requirements using pip

After activating the environment, install the required packages:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

---> 100%
```

</div>

It will install all the dependencies and your local FastAPI in your local environment.

### Using your local FastAPI

If you create a Python file that imports and uses FastAPI, and run it with the Python from your local environment, it will use your cloned local FastAPI source code.

And if you update that local FastAPI source code when you run that Python file again, it will use the fresh version of FastAPI you just edited.

That way, you don't have to "install" your local version to be able to test every change.

/// note | Technical Details

This only happens when you install using this included `requirements.txt` instead of running `pip install fastapi` directly.

That is because inside the `requirements.txt` file, the local version of FastAPI is marked to be installed in "editable" mode, with the `-e` option.

///

### Format the code

There is a script that you can run that will format and clean all your code:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ bash scripts/format.sh
```

</div>

It will also auto-sort all your imports.

## Tests

There is a script that you can run locally to test all the code and generate coverage reports in HTML:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ bash scripts/test-cov-html.sh
```

</div>

This command generates a directory `./htmlcov/`, if you open the file `./htmlcov/index.html` in your browser, you can explore interactively the regions of code that are covered by the tests, and notice if there is any region missing.

## Docs

First, make sure you set up your environment as described above, that will install all the requirements.

### Docs live

During local development, there is a script that builds the site and checks for any changes, live-reloading:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python ./scripts/docs.py live

<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8008
<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Start watching changes
<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Start detecting changes
```

</div>

It will serve the documentation on `http://127.0.0.1:8008`.

That way, you can edit the documentation/source files and see the changes live.

/// tip

Alternatively, you can perform the same steps that scripts does manually.

Go into the language directory, for the main docs in English it's at `docs/en/`:

```console
$ cd docs/en/
```

Then run `mkdocs` in that directory:

```console
$ mkdocs serve --dev-addr 127.0.0.1:8008
```

///

#### Typer CLI (optional)

The instructions here show you how to use the script at `./scripts/docs.py` with the `python` program directly.

But you can also use <a href="https://typer.tiangolo.com/typer-cli/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Typer CLI</a>, and you will get autocompletion in your terminal for the commands after installing completion.

If you install Typer CLI, you can install completion with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ typer --install-completion

zsh completion installed in /home/user/.bashrc.
Completion will take effect once you restart the terminal.
```

</div>

### Docs Structure

The documentation uses <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">MkDocs</a>.

And there are extra tools/scripts in place to handle translations in `./scripts/docs.py`.

/// tip

You don't need to see the code in `./scripts/docs.py`, you just use it in the command line.

///

All the documentation is in Markdown format in the directory `./docs/en/`.

Many of the tutorials have blocks of code.

In most of the cases, these blocks of code are actual complete applications that can be run as is.

In fact, those blocks of code are not written inside the Markdown, they are Python files in the `./docs_src/` directory.

And those Python files are included/injected in the documentation when generating the site.

### Docs for tests

Most of the tests actually run against the example source files in the documentation.

This helps to make sure that:

* The documentation is up-to-date.
* The documentation examples can be run as is.
* Most of the features are covered by the documentation, ensured by test coverage.

#### Apps and docs at the same time

If you run the examples with, e.g.:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi dev tutorial001.py

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>

as Uvicorn by default will use the port `8000`, the documentation on port `8008` won't clash.

### Translations

Help with translations is VERY MUCH appreciated! And it can't be done without the help from the community. 🌎 🚀

Here are the steps to help with translations.

#### Tips and guidelines

* Check the currently <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pulls" class="external-link" target="_blank">existing pull requests</a> for your language. You can filter the pull requests by the ones with the label for your language. For example, for Spanish, the label is <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Alang-es+label%3Aawaiting-review" class="external-link" target="_blank">`lang-es`</a>.

* Review those pull requests, requesting changes or approving them. For the languages I don't speak, I'll wait for several others to review the translation before merging.

/// tip

You can <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request" class="external-link" target="_blank">add comments with change suggestions</a> to existing pull requests.

Check the docs about <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews" class="external-link" target="_blank">adding a pull request review</a> to approve it or request changes.

///

* Check if there's a <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/categories/translations" class="external-link" target="_blank">GitHub Discussion</a> to coordinate translations for your language. You can subscribe to it, and when there's a new pull request to review, an automatic comment will be added to the discussion.

* If you translate pages, add a single pull request per page translated. That will make it much easier for others to review it.

* To check the 2-letter code for the language you want to translate, you can use the table <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes" class="external-link" target="_blank">List of ISO 639-1 codes</a>.

#### Existing language

Let's say you want to translate a page for a language that already has translations for some pages, like Spanish.

In the case of Spanish, the 2-letter code is `es`. So, the directory for Spanish translations is located at `docs/es/`.

/// tip

The main ("official") language is English, located at `docs/en/`.

///

Now run the live server for the docs in Spanish:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Use the command "live" and pass the language code as a CLI argument
$ python ./scripts/docs.py live es

<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8008
<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Start watching changes
<span style="color: green;">[INFO]</span> Start detecting changes
```

</div>

/// tip

Alternatively, you can perform the same steps that scripts does manually.

Go into the language directory, for the Spanish translations it's at `docs/es/`:

```console
$ cd docs/es/
```

Then run `mkdocs` in that directory:

```console
$ mkdocs serve --dev-addr 127.0.0.1:8008
```

///

Now you can go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8008" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8008</a> and see your changes live.

You will see that every language has all the pages. But some pages are not translated and have an info box at the top, about the missing translation.

Now let's say that you want to add a translation for the section [Features](features.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

* Copy the file at:

```
docs/en/docs/features.md
```

* Paste it in exactly the same location but for the language you want to translate, e.g.:

```
docs/es/docs/features.md
```

/// tip

Notice that the only change in the path and file name is the language code, from `en` to `es`.

///

If you go to your browser you will see that now the docs show your new section (the info box at the top is gone). 🎉

Now you can translate it all and see how it looks as you save the file.

#### Don't Translate these Pages

🚨 Don't translate:

* Files under `reference/`
* `release-notes.md`
* `fastapi-people.md`
* `external-links.md`
* `newsletter.md`
* `management-tasks.md`
* `management.md`
* `contributing.md`

Some of these files are updated very frequently and a translation would always be behind, or they include the main content from English source files, etc.

#### New Language

Let's say that you want to add translations for a language that is not yet translated, not even some pages.

Let's say you want to add translations for Creole, and it's not yet there in the docs.

Checking the link from above, the code for "Creole" is `ht`.

The next step is to run the script to generate a new translation directory:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Use the command new-lang, pass the language code as a CLI argument
$ python ./scripts/docs.py new-lang ht

Successfully initialized: docs/ht
```

</div>

Now you can check in your code editor the newly created directory `docs/ht/`.

That command created a file `docs/ht/mkdocs.yml` with a simple config that inherits everything from the `en` version:

```yaml
INHERIT: ../en/mkdocs.yml
```

/// tip

You could also simply create that file with those contents manually.

///

That command also created a dummy file `docs/ht/index.md` for the main page, you can start by translating that one.

You can continue with the previous instructions for an "Existing Language" for that process.

You can make the first pull request with those two files, `docs/ht/mkdocs.yml` and `docs/ht/index.md`. 🎉

#### Preview the result

As already mentioned above, you can use the `./scripts/docs.py` with the `live` command to preview the results (or `mkdocs serve`).

Once you are done, you can also test it all as it would look online, including all the other languages.

To do that, first build all the docs:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Use the command "build-all", this will take a bit
$ python ./scripts/docs.py build-all

Building docs for: en
Building docs for: es
Successfully built docs for: es
```

</div>

This builds all those independent MkDocs sites for each language, combines them, and generates the final output at `./site/`.

Then you can serve that with the command `serve`:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Use the command "serve" after running "build-all"
$ python ./scripts/docs.py serve

Warning: this is a very simple server. For development, use mkdocs serve instead.
This is here only to preview a site with translations already built.
Make sure you run the build-all command first.
Serving at: http://127.0.0.1:8008
```

</div>

#### Translation specific tips and guidelines

* Translate only the Markdown documents (`.md`). Do not translate the code examples at `./docs_src`.

* In code blocks within the Markdown document, translate comments (`# a comment`), but leave the rest unchanged.

* Do not change anything enclosed in "``" (inline code).

* In lines starting with `///` translate only the text part after `|`. Leave the rest unchanged.

* You can translate info boxes like `/// warning` with for example `/// warning | Achtung`. But do not change the word immediately after the `///`, it determines the color of the info box.

* Do not change the paths in links to images, code files, Markdown documents.

* However, when a Markdown document is translated, the `#hash-parts` in links to its headings may change. Update these links if possible.
    * Search for such links in the translated document using the regex `#[^# ]`.
    * Search in all documents already translated into your language for `your-translated-document.md`. For example VS Code has an option "Edit" -> "Find in Files".
    * When translating a document, do not "pre-translate" `#hash-parts` that link to headings in untranslated documents.

# Environment Variables

/// tip

If you already know what "environment variables" are and how to use them, feel free to skip this.

///

An environment variable (also known as "**env var**") is a variable that lives **outside** of the Python code, in the **operating system**, and could be read by your Python code (or by other programs as well).

Environment variables could be useful for handling application **settings**, as part of the **installation** of Python, etc.

## Create and Use Env Vars

You can **create** and use environment variables in the **shell (terminal)**, without needing Python:

//// tab | Linux, macOS, Windows Bash

<div class="termy">

```console
// You could create an env var MY_NAME with
$ export MY_NAME="Wade Wilson"

// Then you could use it with other programs, like
$ echo "Hello $MY_NAME"

Hello Wade Wilson
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
// Create an env var MY_NAME
$ $Env:MY_NAME = "Wade Wilson"

// Use it with other programs, like
$ echo "Hello $Env:MY_NAME"

Hello Wade Wilson
```

</div>

////

## Read env vars in Python

You could also create environment variables **outside** of Python, in the terminal (or with any other method), and then **read them in Python**.

For example you could have a file `main.py` with:

```Python hl_lines="3"
import os

name = os.getenv("MY_NAME", "World")
print(f"Hello {name} from Python")
```

/// tip

The second argument to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/os.html#os.getenv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`os.getenv()`</a> is the default value to return.

If not provided, it's `None` by default, here we provide `"World"` as the default value to use.

///

Then you could call that Python program:

//// tab | Linux, macOS, Windows Bash

<div class="termy">

```console
// Here we don't set the env var yet
$ python main.py

// As we didn't set the env var, we get the default value

Hello World from Python

// But if we create an environment variable first
$ export MY_NAME="Wade Wilson"

// And then call the program again
$ python main.py

// Now it can read the environment variable

Hello Wade Wilson from Python
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
// Here we don't set the env var yet
$ python main.py

// As we didn't set the env var, we get the default value

Hello World from Python

// But if we create an environment variable first
$ $Env:MY_NAME = "Wade Wilson"

// And then call the program again
$ python main.py

// Now it can read the environment variable

Hello Wade Wilson from Python
```

</div>

////

As environment variables can be set outside of the code, but can be read by the code, and don't have to be stored (committed to `git`) with the rest of the files, it's common to use them for configurations or **settings**.

You can also create an environment variable only for a **specific program invocation**, that is only available to that program, and only for its duration.

To do that, create it right before the program itself, on the same line:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Create an env var MY_NAME in line for this program call
$ MY_NAME="Wade Wilson" python main.py

// Now it can read the environment variable

Hello Wade Wilson from Python

// The env var no longer exists afterwards
$ python main.py

Hello World from Python
```

</div>

/// tip

You can read more about it at <a href="https://12factor.net/config" class="external-link" target="_blank">The Twelve-Factor App: Config</a>.

///

## Types and Validation

These environment variables can only handle **text strings**, as they are external to Python and have to be compatible with other programs and the rest of the system (and even with different operating systems, as Linux, Windows, macOS).

That means that **any value** read in Python from an environment variable **will be a `str`**, and any conversion to a different type or any validation has to be done in code.

You will learn more about using environment variables for handling **application settings** in the [Advanced User Guide - Settings and Environment Variables](./advanced/settings.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## `PATH` Environment Variable

There is a **special** environment variable called **`PATH`** that is used by the operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) to find programs to run.

The value of the variable `PATH` is a long string that is made of directories separated by a colon `:` on Linux and macOS, and by a semicolon `;` on Windows.

For example, the `PATH` environment variable could look like this:

//// tab | Linux, macOS

```plaintext
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

This means that the system should look for programs in the directories:

* `/usr/local/bin`
* `/usr/bin`
* `/bin`
* `/usr/sbin`
* `/sbin`

////

//// tab | Windows

```plaintext
C:\Program Files\Python312\Scripts;C:\Program Files\Python312;C:\Windows\System32
```

This means that the system should look for programs in the directories:

* `C:\Program Files\Python312\Scripts`
* `C:\Program Files\Python312`
* `C:\Windows\System32`

////

When you type a **command** in the terminal, the operating system **looks for** the program in **each of those directories** listed in the `PATH` environment variable.

For example, when you type `python` in the terminal, the operating system looks for a program called `python` in the **first directory** in that list.

If it finds it, then it will **use it**. Otherwise it keeps looking in the **other directories**.

### Installing Python and Updating the `PATH`

When you install Python, you might be asked if you want to update the `PATH` environment variable.

//// tab | Linux, macOS

Let's say you install Python and it ends up in a directory `/opt/custompython/bin`.

If you say yes to update the `PATH` environment variable, then the installer will add `/opt/custompython/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.

It could look like this:

```plaintext
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/custompython/bin
```

This way, when you type `python` in the terminal, the system will find the Python program in `/opt/custompython/bin` (the last directory) and use that one.

////

//// tab | Windows

Let's say you install Python and it ends up in a directory `C:\opt\custompython\bin`.

If you say yes to update the `PATH` environment variable, then the installer will add `C:\opt\custompython\bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.

```plaintext
C:\Program Files\Python312\Scripts;C:\Program Files\Python312;C:\Windows\System32;C:\opt\custompython\bin
```

This way, when you type `python` in the terminal, the system will find the Python program in `C:\opt\custompython\bin` (the last directory) and use that one.

////

So, if you type:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python
```

</div>

//// tab | Linux, macOS

The system will **find** the `python` program in `/opt/custompython/bin` and run it.

It would be roughly equivalent to typing:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ /opt/custompython/bin/python
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows

The system will **find** the `python` program in `C:\opt\custompython\bin\python` and run it.

It would be roughly equivalent to typing:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ C:\opt\custompython\bin\python
```

</div>

////

This information will be useful when learning about [Virtual Environments](virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## Conclusion

With this you should have a basic understanding of what **environment variables** are and how to use them in Python.

You can also read more about them in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable" class="external-link" target="_blank">Wikipedia for Environment Variable</a>.

In many cases it's not very obvious how environment variables would be useful and applicable right away. But they keep showing up in many different scenarios when you are developing, so it's good to know about them.

For example, you will need this information in the next section, about [Virtual Environments](virtual-environments.md).

# FastAPI CLI

**FastAPI CLI** is a command line program that you can use to serve your FastAPI app, manage your FastAPI project, and more.

When you install FastAPI (e.g. with `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`), it includes a package called `fastapi-cli`, this package provides the `fastapi` command in the terminal.

To run your FastAPI app for development, you can use the `fastapi dev` command:

<div class="termy">

```console

</div>

The command line program called `fastapi` is **FastAPI CLI**.

FastAPI CLI takes the path to your Python program (e.g. `main.py`) and automatically detects the `FastAPI` instance (commonly named `app`), determines the correct import process, and then serves it.

For production you would use `fastapi run` instead. 🚀

Internally, **FastAPI CLI** uses <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">Uvicorn</a>, a high-performance, production-ready, ASGI server. 😎

## `fastapi dev`

Running `fastapi dev` initiates development mode.

By default, **auto-reload** is enabled, automatically reloading the server when you make changes to your code. This is resource-intensive and could be less stable than when it's disabled. You should only use it for development. It also listens on the IP address `127.0.0.1`, which is the IP for your machine to communicate with itself alone (`localhost`).

## `fastapi run`

Executing `fastapi run` starts FastAPI in production mode by default.

By default, **auto-reload** is disabled. It also listens on the IP address `0.0.0.0`, which means all the available IP addresses, this way it will be publicly accessible to anyone that can communicate with the machine. This is how you would normally run it in production, for example, in a container.

In most cases you would (and should) have a "termination proxy" handling HTTPS for you on top, this will depend on how you deploy your application, your provider might do this for you, or you might need to set it up yourself.

You can learn more about it in the [deployment documentation](deployment/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

* <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>OpenAPI</strong></a> for API creation, including declarations of <abbr title="also known as: endpoints, routes">path</abbr> <abbr title="also known as HTTP methods, as POST, GET, PUT, DELETE">operations</abbr>, parameters, request bodies, security, etc.
* Automatic data model documentation with <a href="https://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>JSON Schema</strong></a> (as OpenAPI itself is based on JSON Schema).
* Designed around these standards, after a meticulous study. Instead of an afterthought layer on top.
* This also allows using automatic **client code generation** in many languages.

### Automatic docs

Interactive API documentation and exploration web user interfaces. As the framework is based on OpenAPI, there are multiple options, 2 included by default.

* <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>Swagger UI</strong></a>, with interactive exploration, call and test your API directly from the browser.

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-03-swagger-02.png)

* Alternative API documentation with <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>ReDoc</strong></a>.

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-06-redoc-02.png)

### Just Modern Python

It's all based on standard **Python type** declarations (thanks to Pydantic). No new syntax to learn. Just standard modern Python.

If you need a 2 minute refresher of how to use Python types (even if you don't use FastAPI), check the short tutorial: [Python Types](python-types.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

You write standard Python with types:

```Python
from datetime import date

from pydantic import BaseModel

# Declare a variable as a str
# and get editor support inside the function
def main(user_id: str):
    return user_id


# A Pydantic model
class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    joined: date
```

That can then be used like:

```Python
my_user: User = User(id=3, name="John Doe", joined="2018-07-19")

second_user_data = {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Mary",
    "joined": "2018-11-30",
}

my_second_user: User = User(**second_user_data)
```

/// info

`**second_user_data` means:

Pass the keys and values of the `second_user_data` dict directly as key-value arguments, equivalent to: `User(id=4, name="Mary", joined="2018-11-30")`

///

### Editor support

All the framework was designed to be easy and intuitive to use, all the decisions were tested on multiple editors even before starting development, to ensure the best development experience.

In the Python developer surveys, it's clear <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2017/#tools-and-features" class="external-link" target="_blank">that one of the most used features is "autocompletion"</a>.

The whole **FastAPI** framework is based to satisfy that. Autocompletion works everywhere.

You will rarely need to come back to the docs.

Here's how your editor might help you:

* in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>:

![editor support](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/vscode-completion.png)

* in <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" class="external-link" target="_blank">PyCharm</a>:

![editor support](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/pycharm-completion.png)

You will get completion in code you might even consider impossible before. As for example, the `price` key inside a JSON body (that could have been nested) that comes from a request.

No more typing the wrong key names, coming back and forth between docs, or scrolling up and down to find if you finally used `username` or `user_name`.

### Short

It has sensible **defaults** for everything, with optional configurations everywhere. All the parameters can be fine-tuned to do what you need and to define the API you need.

But by default, it all **"just works"**.

### Validation

* Validation for most (or all?) Python **data types**, including:
    * JSON objects (`dict`).
    * JSON array (`list`) defining item types.
    * String (`str`) fields, defining min and max lengths.
    * Numbers (`int`, `float`) with min and max values, etc.

* Validation for more exotic types, like:
    * URL.
    * Email.
    * UUID.
    * ...and others.

All the validation is handled by the well-established and robust **Pydantic**.

### Security and authentication

Security and authentication integrated. Without any compromise with databases or data models.

All the security schemes defined in OpenAPI, including:

* HTTP Basic.
* **OAuth2** (also with **JWT tokens**). Check the tutorial on [OAuth2 with JWT](tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.
* API keys in:
    * Headers.
    * Query parameters.
    * Cookies, etc.

Plus all the security features from Starlette (including **session cookies**).

All built as reusable tools and components that are easy to integrate with your systems, data stores, relational and NoSQL databases, etc.

### Dependency Injection

FastAPI includes an extremely easy to use, but extremely powerful <abbr title='also known as "components", "resources", "services", "providers"'><strong>Dependency Injection</strong></abbr> system.

* Even dependencies can have dependencies, creating a hierarchy or **"graph" of dependencies**.
* All **automatically handled** by the framework.
* All the dependencies can require data from requests and **augment the path operation** constraints and automatic documentation.
* **Automatic validation** even for *path operation* parameters defined in dependencies.
* Support for complex user authentication systems, **database connections**, etc.
* **No compromise** with databases, frontends, etc. But easy integration with all of them.

### Unlimited "plug-ins"

Or in other way, no need for them, import and use the code you need.

Any integration is designed to be so simple to use (with dependencies) that you can create a "plug-in" for your application in 2 lines of code using the same structure and syntax used for your *path operations*.

### Tested

* 100% <abbr title="The amount of code that is automatically tested">test coverage</abbr>.
* 100% <abbr title="Python type annotations, with this your editor and external tools can give you better support">type annotated</abbr> code base.
* Used in production applications.

## Starlette features

**FastAPI** is fully compatible with (and based on) <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>Starlette</strong></a>. So, any additional Starlette code you have, will also work.

`FastAPI` is actually a sub-class of `Starlette`. So, if you already know or use Starlette, most of the functionality will work the same way.

With **FastAPI** you get all of **Starlette**'s features (as FastAPI is just Starlette on steroids):

* Seriously impressive performance. It is <a href="https://github.com/encode/starlette#performance" class="external-link" target="_blank">one of the fastest Python frameworks available, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go**</a>.
* **WebSocket** support.
* In-process background tasks.
* Startup and shutdown events.
* Test client built on HTTPX.
* **CORS**, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses.
* **Session and Cookie** support.
* 100% test coverage.
* 100% type annotated codebase.

## Pydantic features

**FastAPI** is fully compatible with (and based on) <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank"><strong>Pydantic</strong></a>. So, any additional Pydantic code you have, will also work.

Including external libraries also based on Pydantic, as <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper">ORM</abbr>s, <abbr title="Object-Document Mapper">ODM</abbr>s for databases.

This also means that in many cases you can pass the same object you get from a request **directly to the database**, as everything is validated automatically.

The same applies the other way around, in many cases you can just pass the object you get from the database **directly to the client**.

With **FastAPI** you get all of **Pydantic**'s features (as FastAPI is based on Pydantic for all the data handling):

* **No brainfuck**:
    * No new schema definition micro-language to learn.
    * If you know Python types you know how to use Pydantic.
* Plays nicely with your **<abbr title="Integrated Development Environment, similar to a code editor">IDE</abbr>/<abbr title="A program that checks for code errors">linter</abbr>/brain**:
    * Because pydantic data structures are just instances of classes you define; auto-completion, linting, mypy and your intuition should all work properly with your validated data.
* Validate **complex structures**:
    * Use of hierarchical Pydantic models, Python `typing`’s `List` and `Dict`, etc.
    * And validators allow complex data schemas to be clearly and easily defined, checked and documented as JSON Schema.
    * You can have deeply **nested JSON** objects and have them all validated and annotated.
* **Extensible**:
    * Pydantic allows custom data types to be defined or you can extend validation with methods on a model decorated with the validator decorator.
* 100% test coverage.

If you are helping a lot of people with their questions, you will become an official [FastAPI Expert](fastapi-people.md#fastapi-experts){.internal-link target=_blank}. 🎉

Just remember, the most important point is: try to be kind. People come with their frustrations and in many cases don't ask in the best way, but try as best as you can to be kind. 🤗

The idea is for the **FastAPI** community to be kind and welcoming. At the same time, don't accept bullying or disrespectful behavior towards others. We have to take care of each other.

---

Here's how to help others with questions (in discussions or issues):

### Understand the question

* Check if you can understand what is the **purpose** and use case of the person asking.

* Then check if the question (the vast majority are questions) is **clear**.

* In many cases the question asked is about an imaginary solution from the user, but there might be a **better** one. If you can understand the problem and use case better, you might be able to suggest a better **alternative solution**.

* If you can't understand the question, ask for more **details**.

### Reproduce the problem

For most of the cases and most of the questions there's something related to the person's **original code**.

In many cases they will only copy a fragment of the code, but that's not enough to **reproduce the problem**.

* You can ask them to provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example" class="external-link" target="_blank">minimal, reproducible, example</a>, that you can **copy-paste** and run locally to see the same error or behavior they are seeing, or to understand their use case better.

* If you are feeling too generous, you can try to **create an example** like that yourself, just based on the description of the problem. Just keep in mind that this might take a lot of time and it might be better to ask them to clarify the problem first.

### Suggest solutions

* After being able to understand the question, you can give them a possible **answer**.

* In many cases, it's better to understand their **underlying problem or use case**, because there might be a better way to solve it than what they are trying to do.

### Ask to close

If they reply, there's a high chance you would have solved their problem, congrats, **you're a hero**! 🦸

* Now, if that solved their problem, you can ask them to:

    * In GitHub Discussions: mark the comment as the **answer**.
    * In GitHub Issues: **close** the issue.

## Watch the GitHub repository

You can "watch" FastAPI in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right): <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi</a>. 👀

If you select "Watching" instead of "Releases only" you will receive notifications when someone creates a new issue or question. You can also specify that you only want to be notified about new issues, or discussions, or PRs, etc.

Then you can try and help them solve those questions.

## Ask Questions

You can <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/new?category=questions" class="external-link" target="_blank">create a new question</a> in the GitHub repository, for example to:

* Ask a **question** or ask about a **problem**.
* Suggest a new **feature**.

**Note**: if you do it, then I'm going to ask you to also help others. 😉

## Review Pull Requests

You can help me review pull requests from others.

Again, please try your best to be kind. 🤗

---

Here's what to keep in mind and how to review a pull request:

### Understand the problem

* First, make sure you **understand the problem** that the pull request is trying to solve. It might have a longer discussion in a GitHub Discussion or issue.

* There's also a good chance that the pull request is not actually needed because the problem can be solved in a **different way**. Then you can suggest or ask about that.

### Don't worry about style

* Don't worry too much about things like commit message styles, I will squash and merge customizing the commit manually.

* Also don't worry about style rules, there are already automatized tools checking that.

And if there's any other style or consistency need, I'll ask directly for that, or I'll add commits on top with the needed changes.

### Check the code

* Check and read the code, see if it makes sense, **run it locally** and see if it actually solves the problem.

* Then **comment** saying that you did that, that's how I will know you really checked it.

/// info

Unfortunately, I can't simply trust PRs that just have several approvals.

Several times it has happened that there are PRs with 3, 5 or more approvals, probably because the description is appealing, but when I check the PRs, they are actually broken, have a bug, or don't solve the problem they claim to solve. 😅

So, it's really important that you actually read and run the code, and let me know in the comments that you did. 🤓

///

* If the PR can be simplified in a way, you can ask for that, but there's no need to be too picky, there might be a lot of subjective points of view (and I will have my own as well 🙈), so it's better if you can focus on the fundamental things.

### Tests

* Help me check that the PR has **tests**.

* Check that the tests **fail** before the PR. 🚨

* Then check that the tests **pass** after the PR. ✅

* Many PRs don't have tests, you can **remind** them to add tests, or you can even **suggest** some tests yourself. That's one of the things that consume most time and you can help a lot with that.

* Then also comment what you tried, that way I'll know that you checked it. 🤓

## Create a Pull Request

You can [contribute](contributing.md){.internal-link target=_blank} to the source code with Pull Requests, for example:

* To fix a typo you found on the documentation.
* To share an article, video, or podcast you created or found about FastAPI by <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/edit/master/docs/en/data/external_links.yml" class="external-link" target="_blank">editing this file</a>.
    * Make sure you add your link to the start of the corresponding section.
* To help [translate the documentation](contributing.md#translations){.internal-link target=_blank} to your language.
    * You can also help to review the translations created by others.
* To propose new documentation sections.
* To fix an existing issue/bug.
    * Make sure to add tests.
* To add a new feature.
    * Make sure to add tests.
    * Make sure to add documentation if it's relevant.

## Help Maintain FastAPI

Help me maintain **FastAPI**! 🤓

There's a lot of work to do, and for most of it, **YOU** can do it.

The main tasks that you can do right now are:

* [Help others with questions in GitHub](#help-others-with-questions-in-github){.internal-link target=_blank} (see the section above).
* [Review Pull Requests](#review-pull-requests){.internal-link target=_blank} (see the section above).

Those two tasks are what **consume time the most**. That's the main work of maintaining FastAPI.

If you can help me with that, **you are helping me maintain FastAPI** and making sure it keeps **advancing faster and better**. 🚀

## Join the chat

Join the 👥 <a href="https://discord.gg/VQjSZaeJmf" class="external-link" target="_blank">Discord chat server</a> 👥 and hang out with others in the FastAPI community.

/// tip

For questions, ask them in <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/new?category=questions" class="external-link" target="_blank">GitHub Discussions</a>, there's a much better chance you will receive help by the [FastAPI Experts](fastapi-people.md#fastapi-experts){.internal-link target=_blank}.

Use the chat only for other general conversations.

///

### Don't use the chat for questions

Keep in mind that as chats allow more "free conversation", it's easy to ask questions that are too general and more difficult to answer, so, you might not receive answers.

In GitHub, the template will guide you to write the right question so that you can more easily get a good answer, or even solve the problem yourself even before asking. And in GitHub I can make sure I always answer everything, even if it takes some time. I can't personally do that with the chat systems. 😅

Conversations in the chat systems are also not as easily searchable as in GitHub, so questions and answers might get lost in the conversation. And only the ones in GitHub count to become a [FastAPI Expert](fastapi-people.md#fastapi-experts){.internal-link target=_blank}, so you will most probably receive more attention in GitHub.

On the other side, there are thousands of users in the chat systems, so there's a high chance you'll find someone to talk to there, almost all the time. 😄

## Sponsor the author

If your **product/company** depends on or is related to **FastAPI** and you want to reach its users, you can sponsor the author (me) through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/tiangolo" class="external-link" target="_blank">GitHub sponsors</a>. Depending on the tier, you could get some extra benefits, like a badge in the docs. 🎁

Thanks! 🚀

# History, Design and Future

Some time ago, <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/issues/3#issuecomment-454956920" class="external-link" target="_blank">a **FastAPI** user asked</a>:

> What’s the history of this project? It seems to have come from nowhere to awesome in a few weeks [...]

Here's a little bit of that history.

## Alternatives

I have been creating APIs with complex requirements for several years (Machine Learning, distributed systems, asynchronous jobs, NoSQL databases, etc), leading several teams of developers.

As part of that, I needed to investigate, test and use many alternatives.

The history of **FastAPI** is in great part the history of its predecessors.

As said in the section [Alternatives](alternatives.md){.internal-link target=_blank}:

<blockquote markdown="1">

**FastAPI** wouldn't exist if not for the previous work of others.

There have been many tools created before that have helped inspire its creation.

I have been avoiding the creation of a new framework for several years. First I tried to solve all the features covered by **FastAPI** using many different frameworks, plug-ins, and tools.

But at some point, there was no other option than creating something that provided all these features, taking the best ideas from previous tools, and combining them in the best way possible, using language features that weren't even available before (Python 3.6+ type hints).

</blockquote>

## Investigation

By using all the previous alternatives I had the chance to learn from all of them, take ideas, and combine them in the best way I could find for myself and the teams of developers I have worked with.

For example, it was clear that ideally it should be based on standard Python type hints.

Also, the best approach was to use already existing standards.

So, before even starting to code **FastAPI**, I spent several months studying the specs for OpenAPI, JSON Schema, OAuth2, etc. Understanding their relationship, overlap, and differences.

## Design

Then I spent some time designing the developer "API" I wanted to have as a user (as a developer using FastAPI).

I tested several ideas in the most popular Python editors: PyCharm, VS Code, Jedi based editors.

By the last <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/#development-tools" class="external-link" target="_blank">Python Developer Survey</a>, that covers about 80% of the users.

It means that **FastAPI** was specifically tested with the editors used by 80% of the Python developers. And as most of the other editors tend to work similarly, all its benefits should work for virtually all editors.

That way I could find the best ways to reduce code duplication as much as possible, to have completion everywhere, type and error checks, etc.

All in a way that provided the best development experience for all the developers.

## Requirements

After testing several alternatives, I decided that I was going to use <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">**Pydantic**</a> for its advantages.

Then I contributed to it, to make it fully compliant with JSON Schema, to support different ways to define constraint declarations, and to improve editor support (type checks, autocompletion) based on the tests in several editors.

During the development, I also contributed to <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">**Starlette**</a>, the other key requirement.

## Development

By the time I started creating **FastAPI** itself, most of the pieces were already in place, the design was defined, the requirements and tools were ready, and the knowledge about the standards and specifications was clear and fresh.

## Future

By this point, it's already clear that **FastAPI** with its ideas is being useful for many people.

It is being chosen over previous alternatives for suiting many use cases better.

Many developers and teams already depend on **FastAPI** for their projects (including me and my team).

But still, there are many improvements and features to come.

**FastAPI** has a great future ahead.

And [your help](help-fastapi.md){.internal-link target=_blank} is greatly appreciated.

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title="also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> (previously known as Swagger) and <a href="https://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a>.

## **Typer**, the FastAPI of CLIs

<a href="https://typer.tiangolo.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://typer.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-margin-vector.svg" style="width: 20%;"></a>

If you are building a <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> app to be used in the terminal instead of a web API, check out <a href="https://typer.tiangolo.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">**Typer**</a>.

**Typer** is FastAPI's little sibling. And it's intended to be the **FastAPI of CLIs**. ⌨️ 🚀

## Requirements

FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants:

* <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette</a> for the web parts.
* <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic</a> for the data parts.

## Installation

Create and activate a <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/virtual-environments/" class="external-link" target="_blank">virtual environment</a> and then install FastAPI:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "fastapi[standard]"

---> 100%
```

</div>

**Note**: Make sure you put `"fastapi[standard]"` in quotes to ensure it works in all terminals.

## Example

### Create it

Create a file `main.py` with:

```Python
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Or use <code>async def</code>...</summary>

If your code uses `async` / `await`, use `async def`:

```Python hl_lines="9  14"
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

**Note**:

If you don't know, check the _"In a hurry?"_ section about <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#in-a-hurry" target="_blank">`async` and `await` in the docs</a>.

</details>

### Run it

Run the server with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ fastapi dev main.py

</div>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>About the command <code>fastapi dev main.py</code>...</summary>

The command `fastapi dev` reads your `main.py` file, detects the **FastAPI** app in it, and starts a server using <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">Uvicorn</a>.

By default, `fastapi dev` will start with auto-reload enabled for local development.

You can read more about it in the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-cli/" target="_blank">FastAPI CLI docs</a>.

</details>

### Check it

Open your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery</a>.

You will see the JSON response as:

```JSON
{"item_id": 5, "q": "somequery"}
```

You already created an API that:

* Receives HTTP requests in the _paths_ `/` and `/items/{item_id}`.
* Both _paths_ take `GET` <em>operations</em> (also known as HTTP _methods_).
* The _path_ `/items/{item_id}` has a _path parameter_ `item_id` that should be an `int`.
* The _path_ `/items/{item_id}` has an optional `str` _query parameter_ `q`.

### Interactive API docs

Now go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui" class="external-link" target="_blank">Swagger UI</a>):

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-01-swagger-ui-simple.png)

### Alternative API docs

And now, go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc</a>.

You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">ReDoc</a>):

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-02-redoc-simple.png)

## Example upgrade

Now modify the file `main.py` to receive a body from a `PUT` request.

Declare the body using standard Python types, thanks to Pydantic.

```Python hl_lines="4  9-12  25-27"
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    is_offer: Union[bool, None] = None


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item_id}
```

The `fastapi dev` server should reload automatically.

### Interactive API docs upgrade

Now go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

* The interactive API documentation will be automatically updated, including the new body:

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-03-swagger-02.png)

* Click on the button "Try it out", it allows you to fill the parameters and directly interact with the API:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-04-swagger-03.png)

* Then click on the "Execute" button, the user interface will communicate with your API, send the parameters, get the results and show them on the screen:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-05-swagger-04.png)

### Alternative API docs upgrade

And now, go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc</a>.

* The alternative documentation will also reflect the new query parameter and body:

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-06-redoc-02.png)

### Recap

In summary, you declare **once** the types of parameters, body, etc. as function parameters.

You do that with standard modern Python types.

You don't have to learn a new syntax, the methods or classes of a specific library, etc.

Just standard **Python**.

For example, for an `int`:

```Python
item_id: int
```

or for a more complex `Item` model:

```Python
item: Item
```

...and with that single declaration you get:

* Editor support, including:
    * Completion.
    * Type checks.
* Validation of data:
    * Automatic and clear errors when the data is invalid.
    * Validation even for deeply nested JSON objects.
* <abbr title="also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling">Conversion</abbr> of input data: coming from the network to Python data and types. Reading from:
    * JSON.
    * Path parameters.
    * Query parameters.
    * Cookies.
    * Headers.
    * Forms.
    * Files.
* <abbr title="also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling">Conversion</abbr> of output data: converting from Python data and types to network data (as JSON):
    * Convert Python types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, etc).
    * `datetime` objects.
    * `UUID` objects.
    * Database models.
    * ...and many more.
* Automatic interactive API documentation, including 2 alternative user interfaces:
    * Swagger UI.
    * ReDoc.

---

Coming back to the previous code example, **FastAPI** will:

* Validate that there is an `item_id` in the path for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
* Validate that the `item_id` is of type `int` for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
    * If it is not, the client will see a useful, clear error.
* Check if there is an optional query parameter named `q` (as in `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery`) for `GET` requests.
    * As the `q` parameter is declared with `= None`, it is optional.
    * Without the `None` it would be required (as is the body in the case with `PUT`).
* For `PUT` requests to `/items/{item_id}`, read the body as JSON:
    * Check that it has a required attribute `name` that should be a `str`.
    * Check that it has a required attribute `price` that has to be a `float`.
    * Check that it has an optional attribute `is_offer`, that should be a `bool`, if present.
    * All this would also work for deeply nested JSON objects.
* Convert from and to JSON automatically.
* Document everything with OpenAPI, that can be used by:
    * Interactive documentation systems.
    * Automatic client code generation systems, for many languages.
* Provide 2 interactive documentation web interfaces directly.

---

We just scratched the surface, but you already get the idea of how it all works.

Try changing the line with:

```Python
    return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item_id}
```

...from:

```Python
        ... "item_name": item.name ...
```

...to:

```Python
        ... "item_price": item.price ...
```

...and see how your editor will auto-complete the attributes and know their types:

![editor support](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/vscode-completion.png)

For a more complete example including more features, see the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/">Tutorial - User Guide</a>.

**Spoiler alert**: the tutorial - user guide includes:

* Declaration of **parameters** from other different places as: **headers**, **cookies**, **form fields** and **files**.
* How to set **validation constraints** as `maximum_length` or `regex`.
* A very powerful and easy to use **<abbr title="also known as components, resources, providers, services, injectables">Dependency Injection</abbr>** system.
* Security and authentication, including support for **OAuth2** with **JWT tokens** and **HTTP Basic** auth.
* More advanced (but equally easy) techniques for declaring **deeply nested JSON models** (thanks to Pydantic).
* **GraphQL** integration with <a href="https://strawberry.rocks" class="external-link" target="_blank">Strawberry</a> and other libraries.
* Many extra features (thanks to Starlette) as:
    * **WebSockets**
    * extremely easy tests based on HTTPX and `pytest`
    * **CORS**
    * **Cookie Sessions**
    * ...and more.

## Performance

Independent TechEmpower benchmarks show **FastAPI** applications running under Uvicorn as <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&runid=7464e520-0dc2-473d-bd34-dbdfd7e85911&hw=ph&test=query&l=zijzen-7" class="external-link" target="_blank">one of the fastest Python frameworks available</a>, only below Starlette and Uvicorn themselves (used internally by FastAPI). (*)

To understand more about it, see the section <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/benchmarks/" class="internal-link" target="_blank">Benchmarks</a>.

## Dependencies

FastAPI depends on Pydantic and Starlette.

### `standard` Dependencies

When you install FastAPI with `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` it comes with the `standard` group of optional dependencies:

Used by Pydantic:

* <a href="https://github.com/JoshData/python-email-validator" target="_blank"><code>email-validator</code></a> - for email validation.

Used by Starlette:

* <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org" target="_blank"><code>httpx</code></a> - Required if you want to use the `TestClient`.
* <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com" target="_blank"><code>jinja2</code></a> - Required if you want to use the default template configuration.
* <a href="https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart" target="_blank"><code>python-multipart</code></a> - Required if you want to support form <abbr title="converting the string that comes from an HTTP request into Python data">"parsing"</abbr>, with `request.form()`.

Used by FastAPI / Starlette:

* <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org" target="_blank"><code>uvicorn</code></a> - for the server that loads and serves your application. This includes `uvicorn[standard]`, which includes some dependencies (e.g. `uvloop`) needed for high performance serving.
* `fastapi-cli` - to provide the `fastapi` command.

### Without `standard` Dependencies

If you don't want to include the `standard` optional dependencies, you can install with `pip install fastapi` instead of `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`.

### Additional Optional Dependencies

There are some additional dependencies you might want to install.

Additional optional Pydantic dependencies:

* <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/pydantic_settings/" target="_blank"><code>pydantic-settings</code></a> - for settings management.
* <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/types/extra_types/extra_types/" target="_blank"><code>pydantic-extra-types</code></a> - for extra types to be used with Pydantic.

Additional optional FastAPI dependencies:

* <a href="https://github.com/ijl/orjson" target="_blank"><code>orjson</code></a> - Required if you want to use `ORJSONResponse`.
* <a href="https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson" target="_blank"><code>ujson</code></a> - Required if you want to use `UJSONResponse`.

# Repository Management Tasks

These are the tasks that can be performed to manage the FastAPI repository by [team members](./fastapi-people.md#team){.internal-link target=_blank}.

/// tip

This section is useful only to a handful of people, team members with permissions to manage the repository. You can probably skip it. 😉

///

...so, you are a [team member of FastAPI](./fastapi-people.md#team){.internal-link target=_blank}? Wow, you are so cool! 😎

You can help with everything on [Help FastAPI - Get Help](./help-fastapi.md){.internal-link target=_blank} the same ways as external contributors. But additionally, there are some tasks that only you (as part of the team) can perform.

Here are the general instructions for the tasks you can perform.

Thanks a lot for your help. 🙇

## Be Nice

First of all, be nice. 😊

You probably are super nice if you were added to the team, but it's worth mentioning it. 🤓

### When Things are Difficult

When things are great, everything is easier, so that doesn't need much instructions. But when things are difficult, here are some guidelines.

Try to find the good side. In general, if people are not being unfriendly, try to thank their effort and interest, even if you disagree with the main subject (discussion, PR), just thank them for being interested in the project, or for having dedicated some time to try to do something.

It's difficult to convey emotion in text, use emojis to help. 😅

In discussions and PRs, in many cases, people bring their frustration and show it without filter, in many cases exaggerating, complaining, being entitled, etc. That's really not nice, and when it happens, it lowers our priority to solve their problems. But still, try to breath, and be gentle with your answers.

Try to avoid using bitter sarcasm or potentially passive-aggressive comments. If something is wrong, it's better to be direct (try to be gentle) than sarcastic.

Try to be as specific and objective as possible, avoid generalizations.

For conversations that are more difficult, for example to reject a PR, you can ask me (@tiangolo) to handle it directly.

## Edit PR Titles

* Edit the PR title to start with an emoji from <a href="https://gitmoji.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">gitmoji</a>.
    * Use the emoji character, not the GitHub code. So, use `🐛` instead of `:bug:`. This is so that it shows up correctly outside of GitHub, for example in the release notes.
    * For translations use the `🌐` emoji ("globe with meridians").
* Start the title with a verb. For example `Add`, `Refactor`, `Fix`, etc. This way the title will say the action that the PR does. Like `Add support for teleporting`, instead of `Teleporting wasn't working, so this PR fixes it`.
* Edit the text of the PR title to start in "imperative", like giving an order. So, instead of `Adding support for teleporting` use `Add support for teleporting`.
* Try to make the title descriptive about what it achieves. If it's a feature, try to describe it, for example `Add support for teleporting` instead of `Create TeleportAdapter class`.
* Do not finish the title with a period (`.`).
* When the PR is for a translation, start with the `🌐` and then `Add {language} translation for` and then the translated file path. For example:

```Markdown
🌐 Add Spanish translation for `docs/es/docs/teleporting.md`
```

Once the PR is merged, a GitHub Action (<a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/latest-changes" class="external-link" target="_blank">latest-changes</a>) will use the PR title to update the latest changes automatically.

So, having a nice PR title will not only look nice in GitHub, but also in the release notes. 📝

## Add Labels to PRs

The same GitHub Action <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/latest-changes" class="external-link" target="_blank">latest-changes</a> uses one label in the PR to decide the section in the release notes to put this PR in.

Make sure you use a supported label from the <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/latest-changes#using-labels" class="external-link" target="_blank">latest-changes list of labels</a>:

* `breaking`: Breaking Changes
    * Existing code will break if they update the version without changing their code. This rarely happens, so this label is not frequently used.
* `security`: Security Fixes
    * This is for security fixes, like vulnerabilities. It would almost never be used.
* `feature`: Features
    * New features, adding support for things that didn't exist before.
* `bug`: Fixes
    * Something that was supported didn't work, and this fixes it. There are many PRs that claim to be bug fixes because the user is doing something in an unexpected way that is not supported, but they considered it what should be supported by default. Many of these are actually features or refactors. But in some cases there's an actual bug.
* `refactor`: Refactors
    * This is normally for changes to the internal code that don't change the behavior. Normally it improves maintainability, or enables future features, etc.
* `upgrade`: Upgrades
    * This is for upgrades to direct dependencies from the project, or extra optional dependencies, normally in `pyproject.toml`. So, things that would affect final users, they would end up receiving the upgrade in their code base once they update. But this is not for upgrades to internal dependencies used for development, testing, docs, etc. Those internal dependencies, normally in `requirements.txt` files or GitHub Action versions should be marked as `internal`, not `upgrade`.
* `docs`: Docs
    * Changes in docs. This includes updating the docs, fixing typos. But it doesn't include changes to translations.
    * You can normally quickly detect it by going to the "Files changed" tab in the PR and checking if the updated file(s) starts with `docs/en/docs`. The original version of the docs is always in English, so in `docs/en/docs`.
* `lang-all`: Translations
    * Use this for translations. You can normally quickly detect it by going to the "Files changed" tab in the PR and checking if the updated file(s) starts with `docs/{some lang}/docs` but not `docs/en/docs`. For example, `docs/es/docs`.
* `internal`: Internal
    * Use this for changes that only affect how the repo is managed. For example upgrades to internal dependencies, changes in GitHub Actions or scripts, etc.

/// tip

Some tools like Dependabot, will add some labels, like `dependencies`, but have in mind that this label is not used by the `latest-changes` GitHub Action, so it won't be used in the release notes. Please make sure one of the labels above is added.

///

## Add Labels to Translation PRs

When there's a PR for a translation, apart from adding the `lang-all` label, also add a label for the language.

There will be a label for each language using the language code, like `lang-{lang code}`, for example, `lang-es` for Spanish, `lang-fr` for French, etc.

* Add the specific language label.
* Add the label `awaiting-review`.

The label `awaiting-review` is special, only used for translations. A GitHub Action will detect it, then it will read the language label, and it will update the GitHub Discussions managing the translations for that language to notify people that there's a new translation to review.

Once a native speaker comes, reviews the PR, and approves it, the GitHub Action will come and remove the `awaiting-review` label, and add the `approved-1` label.

This way, we can notice when there are new translations ready, because they have the `approved-1` label.

## Merge Translation PRs

For Spanish, as I'm a native speaker and it's a language close to me, I will give it a final review myself and in most cases tweak the PR a bit before merging it.

For the other languages, confirm that:

* The title is correct following the instructions above.
* It has the labels `lang-all` and `lang-{lang code}`.
* The PR changes only one Markdown file adding a translation.
    * Or in some cases, at most two files, if they are small, for the same language, and people reviewed them.
    * If it's the first translation for that language, it will have additional `mkdocs.yml` files, for those cases follow the instructions below.
* The PR doesn't add any additional or extraneous files.
* The translation seems to have a similar structure as the original English file.
* The translation doesn't seem to change the original content, for example with obvious additional documentation sections.
* The translation doesn't use different Markdown structures, for example adding HTML tags when the original didn't have them.
* The "admonition" sections, like `tip`, `info`, etc. are not changed or translated. For example:

```
/// tip

This is a tip.

///

```

looks like this:

/// tip

This is a tip.

///

...it could be translated as:

```
/// tip

Esto es un consejo.

///

```

...but needs to keep the exact `tip` keyword. If it was translated to `consejo`, like:

```
/// consejo

Esto es un consejo.

///

```

it would change the style to the default one, it would look like:

/// consejo

Esto es un consejo.

///

Those don't have to be translated, but if they are, they need to be written as:

```
/// tip | consejo

Esto es un consejo.

///

```

Which looks like:

/// tip | consejo

Esto es un consejo.

///

## First Translation PR

When there's a first translation for a language, it will have a `docs/{lang code}/docs/index.md` translated file and a `docs/{lang code}/mkdocs.yml`.

For example, for Bosnian, it would be:

* `docs/bs/docs/index.md`
* `docs/bs/mkdocs.yml`

The `mkdocs.yml` file will have only the following content:

```YAML
INHERIT: ../en/mkdocs.yml
```

The language code would normally be in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes" class="external-link" target="_blank">ISO 639-1 list of language codes</a>.

In any case, the language code should be in the file <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/master/docs/language_names.yml" class="external-link" target="_blank">docs/language_names.yml</a>.

There won't be yet a label for the language code, for example, if it was Bosnian, there wouldn't be a `lang-bs`. Before creating the label and adding it to the PR, create the GitHub Discussion:

* Go to the <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/categories/translations" class="external-link" target="_blank">Translations GitHub Discussions</a>
* Create a new discussion with the title `Bosnian Translations` (or the language name in English)
* A description of:

```Markdown
## Bosnian translations

This is the issue to track translations of the docs to Bosnian. 🚀

Here are the [PRs to review with the label `lang-bs`](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Alang-bs+label%3A%22awaiting-review%22). 🤓
```

Update "Bosnian" with the new language.

And update the search link to point to the new language label that will be created, like `lang-bs`.

Create and add the label to that new Discussion just created, like `lang-bs`.

Then go back to the PR, and add the label, like `lang-bs`, and `lang-all` and `awaiting-review`.

Now the GitHub action will automatically detect the label `lang-bs` and will post in that Discussion that this PR is waiting to be reviewed.

## Review PRs

If a PR doesn't explain what it does or why, ask for more information.

A PR should have a specific use case that it is solving.

* If the PR is for a feature, it should have docs.
    * Unless it's a feature we want to discourage, like support for a corner case that we don't want users to use.
* The docs should include a source example file, not write Python directly in Markdown.
* If the source example(s) file can have different syntax for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, there should be different versions of the file, and they should be shown in tabs in the docs.
* There should be tests testing the source example.
* Before the PR is applied, the new tests should fail.
* After applying the PR, the new tests should pass.
* Coverage should stay at 100%.
* If you see the PR makes sense, or we discussed it and considered it should be accepted, you can add commits on top of the PR to tweak it, to add docs, tests, format, refactor, remove extra files, etc.
* Feel free to comment in the PR to ask for more information, to suggest changes, etc.
* Once you think the PR is ready, move it in the internal GitHub project for me to review it.

## FastAPI People PRs

Every month, a GitHub Action updates the FastAPI People data. Those PRs look like this one: <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pull/11669" class="external-link" target="_blank">👥 Update FastAPI People</a>.

If the tests are passing, you can merge it right away.

## External Links PRs

When people add external links they edit this file <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/master/docs/en/data/external_links.yml" class="external-link" target="_blank">external_links.yml</a>.

* Make sure the new link is in the correct category (e.g. "Podcasts") and language (e.g. "Japanese").
* A new link should be at the top of its list.
* The link URL should work (it should not return a 404).
* The content of the link should be about FastAPI.
* The new addition should have these fields:
    * `author`: The name of the author.
    * `link`: The URL with the content.
    * `title`: The title of the link (the title of the article, podcast, etc).

After checking all these things and ensuring the PR has the right labels, you can merge it.

## Dependabot PRs

Dependabot will create PRs to update dependencies for several things, and those PRs all look similar, but some are way more delicate than others.

* If the PR is for a direct dependency, so, Dependabot is modifying `pyproject.toml`, **don't merge it**. 😱 Let me check it first. There's a good chance that some additional tweaks or updates are needed.
* If the PR updates one of the internal dependencies, for example it's modifying `requirements.txt` files, or GitHub Action versions, if the tests are passing, the release notes (shown in a summary in the PR) don't show any obvious potential breaking change, you can merge it. 😎

# Python Types Intro

Python has support for optional "type hints" (also called "type annotations").

These **"type hints"** or annotations are a special syntax that allow declaring the <abbr title="for example: str, int, float, bool">type</abbr> of a variable.

By declaring types for your variables, editors and tools can give you better support.

This is just a **quick tutorial / refresher** about Python type hints. It covers only the minimum necessary to use them with **FastAPI**... which is actually very little.

**FastAPI** is all based on these type hints, they give it many advantages and benefits.

But even if you never use **FastAPI**, you would benefit from learning a bit about them.

/// note

If you are a Python expert, and you already know everything about type hints, skip to the next chapter.

///

## Motivation

Let's start with a simple example:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial001.py *}

Calling this program outputs:

```
John Doe
```

The function does the following:

* Takes a `first_name` and `last_name`.
* Converts the first letter of each one to upper case with `title()`.
* <abbr title="Puts them together, as one. With the contents of one after the other.">Concatenates</abbr> them with a space in the middle.

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial001.py hl[2] *}

### Edit it

It's a very simple program.

But now imagine that you were writing it from scratch.

At some point you would have started the definition of the function, you had the parameters ready...

But then you have to call "that method that converts the first letter to upper case".

Was it `upper`? Was it `uppercase`? `first_uppercase`? `capitalize`?

Then, you try with the old programmer's friend, editor autocompletion.

You type the first parameter of the function, `first_name`, then a dot (`.`) and then hit `Ctrl+Space` to trigger the completion.

But, sadly, you get nothing useful:

<img src="/img/python-types/image01.png">

### Add types

Let's modify a single line from the previous version.

We will change exactly this fragment, the parameters of the function, from:

```Python
    first_name, last_name
```

to:

```Python
    first_name: str, last_name: str
```

That's it.

Those are the "type hints":

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial002.py hl[1] *}

That is not the same as declaring default values like would be with:

```Python
    first_name="john", last_name="doe"
```

It's a different thing.

We are using colons (`:`), not equals (`=`).

And adding type hints normally doesn't change what happens from what would happen without them.

But now, imagine you are again in the middle of creating that function, but with type hints.

At the same point, you try to trigger the autocomplete with `Ctrl+Space` and you see:

<img src="/img/python-types/image02.png">

With that, you can scroll, seeing the options, until you find the one that "rings a bell":

<img src="/img/python-types/image03.png">

## More motivation

Check this function, it already has type hints:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial003.py hl[1] *}

Because the editor knows the types of the variables, you don't only get completion, you also get error checks:

<img src="/img/python-types/image04.png">

Now you know that you have to fix it, convert `age` to a string with `str(age)`:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial004.py hl[2] *}

## Declaring types

You just saw the main place to declare type hints. As function parameters.

This is also the main place you would use them with **FastAPI**.

### Simple types

You can declare all the standard Python types, not only `str`.

You can use, for example:

* `int`
* `float`
* `bool`
* `bytes`

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial005.py hl[1] *}

### Generic types with type parameters

There are some data structures that can contain other values, like `dict`, `list`, `set` and `tuple`. And the internal values can have their own type too.

These types that have internal types are called "**generic**" types. And it's possible to declare them, even with their internal types.

To declare those types and the internal types, you can use the standard Python module `typing`. It exists specifically to support these type hints.

#### Newer versions of Python

The syntax using `typing` is **compatible** with all versions, from Python 3.6 to the latest ones, including Python 3.9, Python 3.10, etc.

As Python advances, **newer versions** come with improved support for these type annotations and in many cases you won't even need to import and use the `typing` module to declare the type annotations.

If you can choose a more recent version of Python for your project, you will be able to take advantage of that extra simplicity.

In all the docs there are examples compatible with each version of Python (when there's a difference).

For example "**Python 3.6+**" means it's compatible with Python 3.6 or above (including 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, etc). And "**Python 3.9+**" means it's compatible with Python 3.9 or above (including 3.10, etc).

If you can use the **latest versions of Python**, use the examples for the latest version, those will have the **best and simplest syntax**, for example, "**Python 3.10+**".

#### List

For example, let's define a variable to be a `list` of `str`.

//// tab | Python 3.9+

Declare the variable, with the same colon (`:`) syntax.

As the type, put `list`.

As the list is a type that contains some internal types, you put them in square brackets:

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial006_py39.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

From `typing`, import `List` (with a capital `L`):

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial006.py!}
```

Declare the variable, with the same colon (`:`) syntax.

As the type, put the `List` that you imported from `typing`.

As the list is a type that contains some internal types, you put them in square brackets:

```Python hl_lines="4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial006.py!}
```

////

/// info

Those internal types in the square brackets are called "type parameters".

In this case, `str` is the type parameter passed to `List` (or `list` in Python 3.9 and above).

///

That means: "the variable `items` is a `list`, and each of the items in this list is a `str`".

/// tip

If you use Python 3.9 or above, you don't have to import `List` from `typing`, you can use the same regular `list` type instead.

///

By doing that, your editor can provide support even while processing items from the list:

<img src="/img/python-types/image05.png">

Without types, that's almost impossible to achieve.

Notice that the variable `item` is one of the elements in the list `items`.

And still, the editor knows it is a `str`, and provides support for that.

#### Tuple and Set

You would do the same to declare `tuple`s and `set`s:

//// tab | Python 3.9+

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial007_py39.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial007.py!}
```

////

This means:

* The variable `items_t` is a `tuple` with 3 items, an `int`, another `int`, and a `str`.
* The variable `items_s` is a `set`, and each of its items is of type `bytes`.

#### Dict

To define a `dict`, you pass 2 type parameters, separated by commas.

The first type parameter is for the keys of the `dict`.

The second type parameter is for the values of the `dict`:

//// tab | Python 3.9+

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial008_py39.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial008.py!}
```

////

This means:

* The variable `prices` is a `dict`:
    * The keys of this `dict` are of type `str` (let's say, the name of each item).
    * The values of this `dict` are of type `float` (let's say, the price of each item).

#### Union

You can declare that a variable can be any of **several types**, for example, an `int` or a `str`.

In Python 3.6 and above (including Python 3.10) you can use the `Union` type from `typing` and put inside the square brackets the possible types to accept.

In Python 3.10 there's also a **new syntax** where you can put the possible types separated by a <abbr title='also called "bitwise or operator", but that meaning is not relevant here'>vertical bar (`|`)</abbr>.

//// tab | Python 3.10+

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial008b_py310.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial008b.py!}
```

////

In both cases this means that `item` could be an `int` or a `str`.

#### Possibly `None`

You can declare that a value could have a type, like `str`, but that it could also be `None`.

In Python 3.6 and above (including Python 3.10) you can declare it by importing and using `Optional` from the `typing` module.

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009.py!}
```

Using `Optional[str]` instead of just `str` will let the editor help you detect errors where you could be assuming that a value is always a `str`, when it could actually be `None` too.

`Optional[Something]` is actually a shortcut for `Union[Something, None]`, they are equivalent.

This also means that in Python 3.10, you can use `Something | None`:

//// tab | Python 3.10+

```Python hl_lines="1"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009_py310.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+ alternative

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009b.py!}
```

////

#### Using `Union` or `Optional`

If you are using a Python version below 3.10, here's a tip from my very **subjective** point of view:

* 🚨 Avoid using `Optional[SomeType]`
* Instead ✨ **use `Union[SomeType, None]`** ✨.

Both are equivalent and underneath they are the same, but I would recommend `Union` instead of `Optional` because the word "**optional**" would seem to imply that the value is optional, and it actually means "it can be `None`", even if it's not optional and is still required.

I think `Union[SomeType, None]` is more explicit about what it means.

It's just about the words and names. But those words can affect how you and your teammates think about the code.

As an example, let's take this function:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009c.py hl[1,4] *}

The parameter `name` is defined as `Optional[str]`, but it is **not optional**, you cannot call the function without the parameter:

```Python
say_hi()  # Oh, no, this throws an error! 😱
```

The `name` parameter is **still required** (not *optional*) because it doesn't have a default value. Still, `name` accepts `None` as the value:

```Python
say_hi(name=None)  # This works, None is valid 🎉
```

The good news is, once you are on Python 3.10 you won't have to worry about that, as you will be able to simply use `|` to define unions of types:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial009c_py310.py hl[1,4] *}

And then you won't have to worry about names like `Optional` and `Union`. 😎

#### Generic types

These types that take type parameters in square brackets are called **Generic types** or **Generics**, for example:

//// tab | Python 3.10+

You can use the same builtin types as generics (with square brackets and types inside):

* `list`
* `tuple`
* `set`
* `dict`

And the same as with Python 3.8, from the `typing` module:

* `Union`
* `Optional` (the same as with Python 3.8)
* ...and others.

In Python 3.10, as an alternative to using the generics `Union` and `Optional`, you can use the <abbr title='also called "bitwise or operator", but that meaning is not relevant here'>vertical bar (`|`)</abbr> to declare unions of types, that's a lot better and simpler.

////

//// tab | Python 3.9+

You can use the same builtin types as generics (with square brackets and types inside):

* `list`
* `tuple`
* `set`
* `dict`

And the same as with Python 3.8, from the `typing` module:

* `Union`
* `Optional`
* ...and others.

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

* `List`
* `Tuple`
* `Set`
* `Dict`
* `Union`
* `Optional`
* ...and others.

////

### Classes as types

You can also declare a class as the type of a variable.

Let's say you have a class `Person`, with a name:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial010.py hl[1:3] *}

Then you can declare a variable to be of type `Person`:

{* ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial010.py hl[6] *}

And then, again, you get all the editor support:

<img src="/img/python-types/image06.png">

Notice that this means "`one_person` is an **instance** of the class `Person`".

It doesn't mean "`one_person` is the **class** called `Person`".

## Pydantic models

<a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic</a> is a Python library to perform data validation.

You declare the "shape" of the data as classes with attributes.

And each attribute has a type.

Then you create an instance of that class with some values and it will validate the values, convert them to the appropriate type (if that's the case) and give you an object with all the data.

And you get all the editor support with that resulting object.

An example from the official Pydantic docs:

//// tab | Python 3.10+

```Python
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial011_py310.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.9+

```Python
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial011_py39.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

```Python
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial011.py!}
```

////

/// info

To learn more about <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic, check its docs</a>.

///

**FastAPI** is all based on Pydantic.

You will see a lot more of all this in practice in the [Tutorial - User Guide](tutorial/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

/// tip

Pydantic has a special behavior when you use `Optional` or `Union[Something, None]` without a default value, you can read more about it in the Pydantic docs about <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.3/usage/models/#required-fields" class="external-link" target="_blank">Required Optional fields</a>.

///

## Type Hints with Metadata Annotations

Python also has a feature that allows putting **additional <abbr title="Data about the data, in this case, information about the type, e.g. a description.">metadata</abbr>** in these type hints using `Annotated`.

//// tab | Python 3.9+

In Python 3.9, `Annotated` is part of the standard library, so you can import it from `typing`.

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial013_py39.py!}
```

////

//// tab | Python 3.8+

In versions below Python 3.9, you import `Annotated` from `typing_extensions`.

It will already be installed with **FastAPI**.

```Python hl_lines="1  4"
{!> ../../docs_src/python_types/tutorial013.py!}
```

////

Python itself doesn't do anything with this `Annotated`. And for editors and other tools, the type is still `str`.

But you can use this space in `Annotated` to provide **FastAPI** with additional metadata about how you want your application to behave.

The important thing to remember is that **the first *type parameter*** you pass to `Annotated` is the **actual type**. The rest, is just metadata for other tools.

For now, you just need to know that `Annotated` exists, and that it's standard Python. 😎

Later you will see how **powerful** it can be.

/// tip

The fact that this is **standard Python** means that you will still get the **best possible developer experience** in your editor, with the tools you use to analyze and refactor your code, etc. ✨

And also that your code will be very compatible with many other Python tools and libraries. 🚀

///

## Type hints in **FastAPI**

**FastAPI** takes advantage of these type hints to do several things.

With **FastAPI** you declare parameters with type hints and you get:

* **Editor support**.
* **Type checks**.

...and **FastAPI** uses the same declarations to:

* **Define requirements**: from request path parameters, query parameters, headers, bodies, dependencies, etc.
* **Convert data**: from the request to the required type.
* **Validate data**: coming from each request:
    * Generating **automatic errors** returned to the client when the data is invalid.
* **Document** the API using OpenAPI:
    * which is then used by the automatic interactive documentation user interfaces.

This might all sound abstract. Don't worry. You'll see all this in action in the [Tutorial - User Guide](tutorial/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

The important thing is that by using standard Python types, in a single place (instead of adding more classes, decorators, etc), **FastAPI** will do a lot of the work for you.

/// info

If you already went through all the tutorial and came back to see more about types, a good resource is <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">the "cheat sheet" from `mypy`</a>.

## 0.115.0

### Highlights

Now you can declare `Query`, `Header`, and `Cookie` parameters with Pydantic models. 🎉

#### `Query` Parameter Models

Use Pydantic models for `Query` parameters:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Literal

from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

app = FastAPI()


class FilterParams(BaseModel):
    limit: int = Field(100, gt=0, le=100)
    offset: int = Field(0, ge=0)
    order_by: Literal["created_at", "updated_at"] = "created_at"
    tags: list[str] = []


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(filter_query: Annotated[FilterParams, Query()]):
    return filter_query
```

Read the new docs: [Query Parameter Models](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-param-models/).

#### `Header` Parameter Models

Use Pydantic models for `Header` parameters:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import FastAPI, Header
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class CommonHeaders(BaseModel):
    host: str
    save_data: bool
    if_modified_since: str | None = None
    traceparent: str | None = None
    x_tag: list[str] = []


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(headers: Annotated[CommonHeaders, Header()]):
    return headers
```

Read the new docs: [Header Parameter Models](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/header-param-models/).

#### `Cookie` Parameter Models

Use Pydantic models for `Cookie` parameters:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Cookies(BaseModel):
    session_id: str
    fatebook_tracker: str | None = None
    googall_tracker: str | None = None


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(cookies: Annotated[Cookies, Cookie()]):
    return cookies
```

Read the new docs: [Cookie Parameter Models](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cookie-param-models/).

#### Forbid Extra Query (Cookie, Header) Parameters

Use Pydantic models to restrict extra values for `Query` parameters (also applies to `Header` and `Cookie` parameters).

To achieve it, use Pydantic's `model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}`:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Literal

from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

app = FastAPI()


class FilterParams(BaseModel):
    model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}

    limit: int = Field(100, gt=0, le=100)
    offset: int = Field(0, ge=0)
    order_by: Literal["created_at", "updated_at"] = "created_at"
    tags: list[str] = []


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(filter_query: Annotated[FilterParams, Query()]):
    return filter_query
```

This applies to `Query`, `Header`, and `Cookie` parameters, read the new docs:

* [Forbid Extra Query Parameters](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-param-models/#forbid-extra-query-parameters)
* [Forbid Extra Headers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/header-param-models/#forbid-extra-headers)
* [Forbid Extra Cookies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cookie-param-models/#forbid-extra-cookies)

## 0.114.0

You can restrict form fields to only include those declared in a Pydantic model and forbid any extra field sent in the request using Pydantic's `model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}`:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import FastAPI, Form
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class FormData(BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str
    model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}


@app.post("/login/")
async def login(data: Annotated[FormData, Form()]):
    return data
```

## 0.112.0

### Breaking Changes

* ♻️ Add support for `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` with standard dependencies and `python -m fastapi`. PR [#11935](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pull/11935) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

#### Summary

Install with:

```bash
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
```

#### Other Changes

* This adds support for calling the CLI as:

```bash
python -m fastapi
```

* And it upgrades `fastapi-cli[standard] >=0.0.5`.

#### Technical Details

Before this, `fastapi` would include the standard dependencies, with Uvicorn and the `fastapi-cli`, etc.

And `fastapi-slim` would not include those standard dependencies.

Now `fastapi` doesn't include those standard dependencies unless you install with `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`.

Before, you would install `pip install fastapi`, now you should include the `standard` optional dependencies (unless you want to exclude one of those): `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`.

This change is because having the standard optional dependencies installed by default was being inconvenient to several users, and having to install instead `fastapi-slim` was not being a feasible solution.

### Breaking Changes

* 🐛 Fix unhandled growing memory for internal server errors, refactor dependencies with `yield` and `except` to require raising again as in regular Python. PR [#11191](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/11191) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).
    * This is a breaking change (and only slightly) if you used dependencies with `yield`, used `except` in those dependencies, and didn't raise again.
    * This was reported internally by [@rushilsrivastava](https://github.com/rushilsrivastava) as a memory leak when the server had unhandled exceptions that would produce internal server errors, the memory allocated before that point would not be released.
    * Read the new docs: [Dependencies with `yield` and `except`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-with-yield/#dependencies-with-yield-and-except).

In short, if you had dependencies that looked like:

```Python
def my_dep():
    try:
        yield
    except SomeException:
        pass
```

Now you need to make sure you raise again after `except`, just as you would in regular Python:

```Python
def my_dep():
    try:
        yield
    except SomeException:
        raise
```

## 0.106.0

### Breaking Changes

Using resources from dependencies with `yield` in background tasks is no longer supported.

This change is what supports the new features, read below. 🤓

### Dependencies with `yield`, `HTTPException` and Background Tasks

Dependencies with `yield` now can raise `HTTPException` and other exceptions after `yield`. 🎉

Read the new docs here: [Dependencies with `yield` and `HTTPException`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-with-yield/#dependencies-with-yield-and-httpexception).

```Python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException
from typing_extensions import Annotated

app = FastAPI()


data = {
    "plumbus": {"description": "Freshly pickled plumbus", "owner": "Morty"},
    "portal-gun": {"description": "Gun to create portals", "owner": "Rick"},
}


class OwnerError(Exception):
    pass


def get_username():
    try:
        yield "Rick"
    except OwnerError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"Owner error: {e}")


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def get_item(item_id: str, username: Annotated[str, Depends(get_username)]):
    if item_id not in data:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    item = data[item_id]
    if item["owner"] != username:
        raise OwnerError(username)
    return item
```

---

Before FastAPI 0.106.0, raising exceptions after `yield` was not possible, the exit code in dependencies with `yield` was executed *after* the response was sent, so [Exception Handlers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/#install-custom-exception-handlers) would have already run.

This was designed this way mainly to allow using the same objects "yielded" by dependencies inside of background tasks, because the exit code would be executed after the background tasks were finished.

Nevertheless, as this would mean waiting for the response to travel through the network while unnecessarily holding a resource in a dependency with yield (for example a database connection), this was changed in FastAPI 0.106.0.

Additionally, a background task is normally an independent set of logic that should be handled separately, with its own resources (e.g. its own database connection).

If you used to rely on this behavior, now you should create the resources for background tasks inside the background task itself, and use internally only data that doesn't depend on the resources of dependencies with `yield`.

For example, instead of using the same database session, you would create a new database session inside of the background task, and you would obtain the objects from the database using this new session. And then instead of passing the object from the database as a parameter to the background task function, you would pass the ID of that object and then obtain the object again inside the background task function.

The sequence of execution before FastAPI 0.106.0 was like this diagram:

Time flows from top to bottom. And each column is one of the parts interacting or executing code.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

participant client as Client
participant handler as Exception handler
participant dep as Dep with yield
participant operation as Path Operation
participant tasks as Background tasks

    Note over client,tasks: Can raise exception for dependency, handled after response is sent
    Note over client,operation: Can raise HTTPException and can change the response
    client ->> dep: Start request
    Note over dep: Run code up to yield
    opt raise
        dep -->> handler: Raise HTTPException
        handler -->> client: HTTP error response
        dep -->> dep: Raise other exception
    end
    dep ->> operation: Run dependency, e.g. DB session
    opt raise
        operation -->> dep: Raise HTTPException
        dep -->> handler: Auto forward exception
        handler -->> client: HTTP error response
        operation -->> dep: Raise other exception
        dep -->> handler: Auto forward exception
    end
    operation ->> client: Return response to client
    Note over client,operation: Response is already sent, can't change it anymore
    opt Tasks
        operation -->> tasks: Send background tasks
    end
    opt Raise other exception
        tasks -->> dep: Raise other exception
    end
    Note over dep: After yield
    opt Handle other exception
        dep -->> dep: Handle exception, can't change response. E.g. close DB session.
    end
```

The new execution flow can be found in the docs: [Execution of dependencies with `yield`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-with-yield/#execution-of-dependencies-with-yield).

## 0.100.0

✨ Support for **Pydantic v2** ✨

Pydantic version 2 has the **core** re-written in **Rust** and includes a lot of improvements and features, for example:

* Improved **correctness** in corner cases.
* **Safer** types.
* Better **performance** and **less energy** consumption.
* Better **extensibility**.
* etc.

...all this while keeping the **same Python API**. In most of the cases, for simple models, you can simply upgrade the Pydantic version and get all the benefits. 🚀

In some cases, for pure data validation and processing, you can get performance improvements of **20x** or more. This means 2,000% or more. 🤯

When you use **FastAPI**, there's a lot more going on, processing the request and response, handling dependencies, executing **your own code**, and particularly, **waiting for the network**. But you will probably still get some nice performance improvements just from the upgrade.

The focus of this release is **compatibility** with Pydantic v1 and v2, to make sure your current apps keep working. Later there will be more focus on refactors, correctness, code improvements, and then **performance** improvements. Some third-party early beta testers that ran benchmarks on the beta releases of FastAPI reported improvements of **2x - 3x**. Which is not bad for just doing `pip install --upgrade fastapi pydantic`. This was not an official benchmark and I didn't check it myself, but it's a good sign.

### Migration

Check out the [Pydantic migration guide](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.0/migration/).

For the things that need changes in your Pydantic models, the Pydantic team built [`bump-pydantic`](https://github.com/pydantic/bump-pydantic).

A command line tool that will **process your code** and update most of the things **automatically** for you. Make sure you have your code in git first, and review each of the changes to make sure everything is correct before committing the changes.

### Pydantic v1

**This version of FastAPI still supports Pydantic v1**. And although Pydantic v1 will be deprecated at some point, it will still be supported for a while.

This means that you can install the new Pydantic v2, and if something fails, you can install Pydantic v1 while you fix any problems you might have, but having the latest FastAPI.

There are **tests for both Pydantic v1 and v2**, and test **coverage** is kept at **100%**.

### Changes

* There are **new parameter** fields supported by Pydantic `Field()` for:

    * `Path()`
    * `Query()`
    * `Header()`
    * `Cookie()`
    * `Body()`
    * `Form()`
    * `File()`

* The new parameter fields are:

    * `default_factory`
    * `alias_priority`
    * `validation_alias`
    * `serialization_alias`
    * `discriminator`
    * `strict`
    * `multiple_of`
    * `allow_inf_nan`
    * `max_digits`
    * `decimal_places`
    * `json_schema_extra`

...you can read about them in the Pydantic docs.

* The parameter `regex` has been deprecated and replaced by `pattern`.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Query Parameters and String Validations: Add regular expressions](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#add-regular-expressions).
* New Pydantic models use an improved and simplified attribute `model_config` that takes a simple dict instead of an internal class `Config` for their configuration.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Declare Request Example Data](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/schema-extra-example/).
* The attribute `schema_extra` for the internal class `Config` has been replaced by the key `json_schema_extra` in the new `model_config` dict.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Declare Request Example Data](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/schema-extra-example/).
* When you install `"fastapi[all]"` it now also includes:
    * <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/pydantic_settings/" target="_blank"><code>pydantic-settings</code></a> - for settings management.
    * <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/types/extra_types/extra_types/" target="_blank"><code>pydantic-extra-types</code></a> - for extra types to be used with Pydantic.
* Now Pydantic Settings is an additional optional package (included in `"fastapi[all]"`). To use settings you should now import `from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings` instead of importing from `pydantic` directly.
    * You can read more about it in the docs for [Settings and Environment Variables](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/settings/).

* PR [#9816](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/9816) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo), included all the work done (in multiple PRs) on the beta branch (`main-pv2`).

## 0.95.0

### Highlights

This release adds support for dependencies and parameters using `Annotated` and recommends its usage. ✨

This has **several benefits**, one of the main ones is that now the parameters of your functions with `Annotated` would **not be affected** at all.

If you call those functions in **other places in your code**, the actual **default values** will be kept, your editor will help you notice missing **required arguments**, Python will require you to pass required arguments at **runtime**, you will be able to **use the same functions** for different things and with different libraries (e.g. **Typer** will soon support `Annotated` too, then you could use the same function for an API and a CLI), etc.

Because `Annotated` is **standard Python**, you still get all the **benefits** from editors and tools, like **autocompletion**, **inline errors**, etc.

One of the **biggest benefits** is that now you can create `Annotated` dependencies that are then shared by multiple *path operation functions*, this will allow you to **reduce** a lot of **code duplication** in your codebase, while keeping all the support from editors and tools.

For example, you could have code like this:

```Python
def get_current_user(token: str):
    # authenticate user
    return User()


@app.get("/items/")
def read_items(user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    ...


@app.post("/items/")
def create_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item: Item):
    ...


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item_id: int):
    ...


@app.delete("/items/{item_id}")
def delete_item(*, user: User = Depends(get_current_user), item_id: int):
    ...
```

There's a bit of code duplication for the dependency:

```Python
user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
```

...the bigger the codebase, the more noticeable it is.

Now you can create an annotated dependency once, like this:

```Python
CurrentUser = Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)]
```

And then you can reuse this `Annotated` dependency:

```Python
CurrentUser = Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)]


@app.get("/items/")
def read_items(user: CurrentUser):
    ...


@app.post("/items/")
def create_item(user: CurrentUser, item: Item):
    ...


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(user: CurrentUser, item_id: int):
    ...


@app.delete("/items/{item_id}")
def delete_item(user: CurrentUser, item_id: int):
    ...
```

...and `CurrentUser` has all the typing information as `User`, so your editor will work as expected (autocompletion and everything), and **FastAPI** will be able to understand the dependency defined in `Annotated`. 😎

Roughly **all the docs** have been rewritten to use `Annotated` as the main way to declare **parameters** and **dependencies**. All the **examples** in the docs now include a version with `Annotated` and a version without it, for each of the specific Python versions (when there are small differences/improvements in more recent versions). There were around 23K new lines added between docs, examples, and tests. 🚀

The key updated docs are:

* Python Types Intro:
    * [Type Hints with Metadata Annotations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/python-types/#type-hints-with-metadata-annotations).
* Tutorial:
    * [Query Parameters and String Validations - Additional validation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#additional-validation)
        * [Advantages of `Annotated`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#advantages-of-annotated)
    * [Path Parameters and Numeric Validations - Order the parameters as you need, tricks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params-numeric-validations/#order-the-parameters-as-you-need-tricks)
        * [Better with `Annotated`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params-numeric-validations/#better-with-annotated)
    * [Dependencies - First Steps - Share `Annotated` dependencies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/#share-annotated-dependencies)

## 0.93.0

### Features

* ✨ Add support for `lifespan` async context managers (superseding `startup` and `shutdown` events). Initial PR [#2944](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2944) by [@uSpike](https://github.com/uSpike).

Now, instead of using independent `startup` and `shutdown` events, you can define that logic in a single function with `yield` decorated with `@asynccontextmanager` (an async context manager).

For example:

```Python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

from fastapi import FastAPI


def fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model(x: float):
    return x * 42


ml_models = {}


@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Load the ML model
    ml_models["answer_to_everything"] = fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model
    yield
    # Clean up the ML models and release the resources
    ml_models.clear()


app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)


@app.get("/predict")
async def predict(x: float):
    result = ml_models["answer_to_everything"](x)
    return {"result": result}
```

**Note**: This is the recommended way going forward, instead of using `startup` and `shutdown` events.

Read more about it in the new docs: [Advanced User Guide: Lifespan Events](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/).

## 0.92.0

🚨 This is a security fix. Please upgrade as soon as possible.

### Upgrades

* ⬆️ Upgrade Starlette to 0.25.0. PR [#5996](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/5996) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).
    * This solves a vulnerability that could allow denial of service attacks by using many small multipart fields/files (parts), consuming high CPU and memory.
    * Only applications using forms (e.g. file uploads) could be affected.
    * For most cases, upgrading won't have any breaking changes.

## 0.91.0

### Upgrades

* ⬆️ Upgrade Starlette version to `0.24.0` and refactor internals for compatibility. PR [#5985](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/5985) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).
    * This can solve nuanced errors when using middlewares. Before Starlette `0.24.0`, a new instance of each middleware class would be created when a new middleware was added. That normally was not a problem, unless the middleware class expected to be created only once, with only one instance, that happened in some cases. This upgrade would solve those cases (thanks [@adriangb](https://github.com/adriangb)! Starlette PR [#2017](https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/2017)). Now the middleware class instances are created once, right before the first request (the first time the app is called).
    * If you depended on that previous behavior, you might need to update your code. As always, make sure your tests pass before merging the upgrade.

## 0.90.1

## 0.89.0

### Features

* ✨ Add support for function return type annotations to declare the `response_model`. Initial PR [#1436](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1436) by [@uriyyo](https://github.com/uriyyo).

Now you can declare the return type / `response_model` in the function return type annotation:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items() -> list[Item]:
    return [
        Item(name="Portal Gun", price=42.0),
        Item(name="Plumbus", price=32.0),
    ]
```

FastAPI will use the return type annotation to perform:

* Data validation
* Automatic documentation
    * It could power automatic client generators
* **Data filtering**

Before this version it was only supported via the `response_model` parameter.

Read more about it in the new docs: [Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).

## 0.87.0

Highlights of this release:

* [Upgraded Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette/releases/tag/0.21.0)
    * Now the `TestClient` is based on HTTPX instead of Requests. 🚀
    * There are some possible **breaking changes** in the `TestClient` usage, but [@Kludex](https://github.com/Kludex) built [bump-testclient](https://github.com/Kludex/bump-testclient) to help you automatize migrating your tests. Make sure you are using Git and that you can undo any unnecessary changes (false positive changes, etc) before using `bump-testclient`.
* New [WebSocketException (and docs)](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/#using-depends-and-others), re-exported from Starlette.
* Upgraded and relaxed dependencies for package extras `all` (including new Uvicorn version), when you install `"fastapi[all]"`.
* New docs about how to [**Help Maintain FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#help-maintain-fastapi).

### Breaking Changes - Fixes

* 🐛 Fix `response_model` not invalidating `None`. PR [#2725](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2725) by [@hukkin](https://github.com/hukkin).

If you are using `response_model` with some type that doesn't include `None` but the function is returning `None`, it will now raise an internal server error, because you are returning invalid data that violates the contract in `response_model`. Before this release it would allow breaking that contract returning `None`.

For example, if you have an app like this:

```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: Optional[float] = None
    owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/invalidnone", response_model=Item)
def get_invalid_none():
    return None
```

...calling the path `/items/invalidnone` will raise an error, because `None` is not a valid type for the `response_model` declared with `Item`.

You could also be implicitly returning `None` without realizing, for example:

```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: Optional[float] = None
    owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/invalidnone", response_model=Item)
def get_invalid_none():
    if flag:
        return {"name": "foo"}
    # if flag is False, at this point the function will implicitly return None
```

If you have *path operations* using `response_model` that need to be allowed to return `None`, make it explicit in `response_model` using `Union[Something, None]`:

```Python
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: Optional[float] = None
    owner_ids: Optional[List[int]] = None

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/invalidnone", response_model=Union[Item, None])
def get_invalid_none():
    return None
```

This way the data will be correctly validated, you won't have an internal server error, and the documentation will also reflect that this *path operation* could return `None` (or `null` in JSON).

* 🐛 Fix removing body from status codes that do not support it. PR [#5145](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/5145) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).
    * Setting `status_code` to `204`, `304`, or any code below `200` (1xx) will remove the body from the response.
    * This fixes an error in Uvicorn that otherwise would be thrown: `RuntimeError: Response content longer than Content-Length`.

## 0.78.0

### Features

* ✨ Add support for omitting `...` as default value when declaring required parameters with:

* `Path()`
* `Query()`
* `Header()`
* `Cookie()`
* `Body()`
* `Form()`
* `File()`

New docs at [Tutorial - Query Parameters and String Validations - Make it required](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#make-it-required). PR [#4906](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4906) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

Up to now, declaring a required parameter while adding additional validation or metadata needed using `...` (Ellipsis).

For example:

```Python
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def main(
    item_id: int = Path(default=..., gt=0),
    query: str = Query(default=..., max_length=10),
    session: str = Cookie(default=..., min_length=3),
    x_trace: str = Header(default=..., title="Tracing header"),
):
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

...all these parameters are required because the default value is `...` (Ellipsis).

But now it's possible and supported to just omit the default value, as would be done with Pydantic fields, and the parameters would still be required.

✨ For example, this is now supported:

```Python
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def main(
    item_id: int = Path(gt=0),
    query: str = Query(max_length=10),
    session: str = Cookie(min_length=3),
    x_trace: str = Header(title="Tracing header"),
):
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

To declare parameters as optional (not required), you can set a default value as always, for example using `None`:

```Python
from typing import Union
from fastapi import Cookie, FastAPI, Header, Path, Query

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def main(
    item_id: int = Path(gt=0),
    query: Union[str, None] = Query(default=None, max_length=10),
    session: Union[str, None] = Cookie(default=None, min_length=3),
    x_trace: Union[str, None] = Header(default=None, title="Tracing header"),
):
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

## 0.75.0

### Features

* ✨ Add support for custom `generate_unique_id_function` and docs for generating clients. New docs: [Advanced - Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/). PR [#4650](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4650) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

## 0.74.1

### Features

* ✨ Include route in scope to allow middleware and other tools to extract its information. PR [#4603](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4603) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

## 0.74.0

### Breaking Changes

* ✨ Update internal `AsyncExitStack` to fix context for dependencies with `yield`. PR [#4575](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4575) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

Dependencies with `yield` can now catch `HTTPException` and custom exceptions. For example:

```Python
async def get_database():
    with Session() as session:
        try:
            yield session
        except HTTPException:
            session.rollback()
            raise
        finally:
            session.close()
```

After the dependency with `yield` handles the exception (or not) the exception is raised again. So that any exception handlers can catch it, or ultimately the default internal `ServerErrorMiddleware`.

If you depended on exceptions not being received by dependencies with `yield`, and receiving an exception breaks the code after `yield`, you can use a block with `try` and `finally`:

```Python
async def do_something():
    try:
        yield something
    finally:
        some_cleanup()
```

...that way the `finally` block is run regardless of any exception that might happen.

### Features

* The same PR [#4575](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4575) from above also fixes the `contextvars` context for the code before and after `yield`. This was the main objective of that PR.

This means that now, if you set a value in a context variable before `yield`, the value would still be available after `yield` (as you would intuitively expect). And it also means that you can reset the context variable with a token afterwards.

For example, this works correctly now:

```Python
from contextvars import ContextVar
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional


legacy_request_state_context_var: ContextVar[Optional[Dict[str, Any]]] = ContextVar(
    "legacy_request_state_context_var", default=None
)

async def set_up_request_state_dependency():
    request_state = {"user": "deadpond"}
    contextvar_token = legacy_request_state_context_var.set(request_state)
    yield request_state
    legacy_request_state_context_var.reset(contextvar_token)
```

...before this change it would raise an error when resetting the context variable, because the `contextvars` context was different, because of the way it was implemented.

**Note**: You probably don't need `contextvars`, and you should probably avoid using them. But they are powerful and useful in some advanced scenarios, for example, migrating from code that used Flask's `g` semi-global variable.

**Technical Details**: If you want to know more of the technical details you can check out the PR description [#4575](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4575).

## 0.70.0

This release just upgrades Starlette to the latest version, `0.16.0`, which includes several bug fixes and some small breaking changes.

These last **three consecutive releases** are independent so that you can **migrate gradually**:

* First to FastAPI `0.68.2`, with no breaking changes, but upgrading all the sub-dependencies.
* Next to FastAPI `0.69.0`, which upgrades Starlette to `0.15.0`, with AnyIO support, and a higher chance of having breaking changes in your code.
* Finally to FastAPI `0.70.0`, just upgrading Starlette to the latest version `0.16.0` with additional bug fixes.

This way, in case there was a breaking change for your code in one of the releases, you can still benefit from the previous upgrades. ✨

### Breaking Changes - Upgrade

* ⬆️ Upgrade Starlette to 0.16.0. PR [#4016](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4016) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

Also upgrades the ranges of optional dependencies:

* `"jinja2 >=2.11.2,<4.0.0"`
* `"itsdangerous >=1.1.0,<3.0.0"`

## 0.69.0

### Breaking Changes - Upgrade

This release adds support for [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). ✨

It upgrades the version of Starlette to `0.15.0`, now based on [AnyIO](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and the internal async components in **FastAPI** are now based on AnyIO as well, making it compatible with both **asyncio** and **Trio**.

You can read the docs about running [FastAPI with Trio using Hypercorn](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/manually/#hypercorn-with-trio).

This release also removes `graphene` as an optional dependency for GraphQL. If you need to work with GraphQL, the recommended library now is [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/). You can read the new [FastAPI with GraphQL docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/graphql/).

### Features

## 0.68.2

This release has **no breaking changes**. 🎉

It upgrades the version ranges of sub-dependencies to allow applications using FastAPI to easily upgrade them.

Soon there will be a new FastAPI release upgrading Starlette to take advantage of recent improvements, but as that has a higher chance of having breaking changes, it will be in a separate release.

## 0.65.2

### Security fixes

* 🔒 Check Content-Type request header before assuming JSON. Initial PR [#2118](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2118) by [@patrickkwang](https://github.com/patrickkwang).

This change fixes a [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) security vulnerability when using cookies for authentication in path operations with JSON payloads sent by browsers.

In versions lower than `0.65.2`, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the `content-type` header sent was not set to `application/json` or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. `application/geo+json`).

So, a request with a content type of `text/plain` containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted.

But requests with content type `text/plain` are exempt from [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) preflights, for being considered [Simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests). So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application.

See [CVE-2021-32677](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/security/advisories/GHSA-8h2j-cgx8-6xv7) for more details.

## 0.62.0

### Features

* ✨ Add support for shared/top-level parameters (dependencies, tags, etc). PR [#2434](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2434) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

Up to now, for several options, the only way to apply them to a group of *path operations* was in `include_router`. That works well, but the call to `app.include_router()` or `router.include_router()` is normally done in another file.

That means that, for example, to apply authentication to all the *path operations* in a router it would end up being done in a different file, instead of keeping related logic together.

Setting options in `include_router` still makes sense in some cases, for example, to override or increase configurations from a third party router included in an app. But in a router that is part of a bigger application, it would probably make more sense to add those settings when creating the `APIRouter`.

**In `FastAPI`**

This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

* `default_response_class`: updated to handle defaults in `APIRouter` and `include_router`.
* `dependencies`: to include ✨ top-level dependencies ✨ that apply to the whole application. E.g. to add global authentication.
* `callbacks`: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the *path operations*.
* `deprecated`: to mark all the *path operations* as deprecated. 🤷
* `include_in_schema`: to allow excluding all the *path operations* from the OpenAPI schema.
* `responses`: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the *path operations*.

For example:

```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends


async def some_dependency():
    return


app = FastAPI(dependencies=[Depends(some_dependency)])
```

**In `APIRouter`**

This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

* `default_response_class`: updated to handle defaults in `APIRouter` and `include_router`. For example, it's not needed to set it explicitly when [creating callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).
* `dependencies`: to include ✨ router-level dependencies ✨ that apply to all the *path operations* in a router. Up to now, this was only possible with `include_router`.
* `callbacks`: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the *path operations* in this router.
* `deprecated`: to mark all the *path operations* in a router as deprecated.
* `include_in_schema`: to allow excluding all the *path operations* in a router from the OpenAPI schema.
* `responses`: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the *path operations* in a router.
* `prefix`: to set the path prefix for a router. Up to now, this was only possible when calling `include_router`.
* `tags`: OpenAPI tags to apply to all the *path operations* in this router.

For example:

```Python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends


async def some_dependency():
    return


router = APIRouter(prefix="/users", dependencies=[Depends(some_dependency)])
```

**In `include_router`**

Most of these settings are now supported in `APIRouter`, which normally lives closer to the related code, so it is recommended to use `APIRouter` when possible.

But `include_router` is still useful to, for example, adding options (like `dependencies`, `prefix`, and `tags`) when including a third party router, or a generic router that is shared between several projects.

This PR allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

* `default_response_class`: updated to handle defaults in `APIRouter` and `FastAPI`.
* `deprecated`: to mark all the *path operations* in a router as deprecated in OpenAPI.
* `include_in_schema`: to allow disabling all the *path operations* from showing in the OpenAPI schema.
* `callbacks`: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the *path operations* in this router.

Note: all the previous parameters are still there, so it's still possible to declare `dependencies` in `include_router`.

### Breaking Changes

* PR [#2434](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2434) includes several improvements that shouldn't affect normal use cases, but could affect in advanced scenarios:
    * If you are testing the generated OpenAPI (you shouldn't, FastAPI already tests it extensively for you): the order for `tags` in `include_router` and *path operations* was updated for consistency, but it's a simple order change.
    * If you have advanced custom logic to access each route's `route.response_class`, or the `router.default_response_class`, or the `app.default_response_class`: the default value for `response_class` in `APIRoute` and for `default_response_class` in `APIRouter` and `FastAPI` is now a `DefaultPlaceholder` used internally to handle and solve default values and overrides. The actual response class inside the `DefaultPlaceholder` is available at `route.response_class.value`.

### Internal

* Improve docs maintainability by updating `hl_lines` syntax to use ranges. PR [#1863](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1863) by [@la-mar](https://github.com/la-mar).

## 0.61.0

### Features

* Add support for injecting `HTTPConnection` (as `Request` and `WebSocket`). Useful for sharing app state in dependencies. PR [#1827](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1827) by [@nsidnev](https://github.com/nsidnev).
* Export `WebSocketDisconnect` and add example handling WebSocket disconnections to docs. PR [#1822](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1822) by [@rkbeatss](https://github.com/rkbeatss).

### Breaking Changes

* Require Pydantic > `1.0.0`.
    * Remove support for deprecated Pydantic `0.32.2`. This improves maintainability and allows new features.
    * In `FastAPI` and `APIRouter`:
        * Remove *path operation decorators* related/deprecated parameter `response_model_skip_defaults` (use `response_model_exclude_unset` instead).
        * Change *path operation decorators* parameter default for `response_model_exclude` from `set()` to `None` (as is in Pydantic).
    * In `encoders.jsonable_encoder`:
        * Remove deprecated `skip_defaults`, use instead `exclude_unset`.
        * Set default of `exclude` from `set()` to `None` (as is in Pydantic).
    * PR [#1862](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1862).
* In `encoders.jsonable_encoder` remove parameter `sqlalchemy_safe`.
    * It was an early hack to allow returning SQLAlchemy models, but it was never documented, and the recommended way is using Pydantic's `orm_mode` as described in the tutorial: [SQL (Relational) Databases](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/).
    * PR [#1864](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1864).

### Docs

* Add link to the course by TestDriven.io: [Test-Driven Development with FastAPI and Docker](https://testdriven.io/courses/tdd-fastapi/). PR [#1860](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1860).

* Add docs about [Async Tests](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/async-tests/). PR [#1619](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1619) by [@empicano](https://github.com/empicano).
* Raise an exception when using form data (`Form`, `File`) without having `python-multipart` installed.
    * Up to now the application would run, and raise an exception only when receiving a request with form data, the new behavior, raising early, will prevent from deploying applications with broken dependencies.
    * It also detects if the correct package `python-multipart` is installed instead of the incorrect `multipart` (both importable as `multipart`).
    * PR [#1851](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1851) based on original PR [#1627](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1627) by [@chrisngyn](https://github.com/chrisngyn), [@YKo20010](https://github.com/YKo20010), [@kx-chen](https://github.com/kx-chen).

## 0.42.0

* Add dependencies with `yield`, a.k.a. exit steps, context managers, cleanup, teardown, ...
    * This allows adding extra code after a dependency is done. It can be used, for example, to close database connections.
    * Dependencies with `yield` can be normal or `async`, **FastAPI** will run normal dependencies in a threadpool.
    * They can be combined with normal dependencies.
    * It's possible to have arbitrary trees/levels of dependencies with `yield` and exit steps are handled in the correct order automatically.
    * It works by default in Python 3.7 or above. For Python 3.6, it requires the extra backport dependencies:
        * `async-exit-stack`
        * `async-generator`
    * New docs at [Dependencies with `yield`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-with-yield/).

    * Add `State` to FastAPI apps at `app.state`.
    * PR [#593](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/593).
* Improve handling of custom classes for `Request`s and `APIRoute`s.
    * This helps to more easily solve use cases like:
        * Reading a body before and/or after a request (equivalent to a middleware).
        * Run middleware-like code only for a subset of *path operations*.
        * Process a request before passing it to a *path operation function*. E.g. decompressing, deserializing, etc.
        * Processing a response after being generated by *path operation functions* but before returning it. E.g. adding custom headers, logging, adding extra metadata.
    * New docs section: [Custom Request and APIRoute class](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-request-and-route/).
    * PR [#589](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/589) by [@dmontagu](https://github.com/dmontagu).

## 0.39.0

* Allow path parameters to have default values (e.g. `None`) and discard them instead of raising an error.
    * This allows declaring a parameter like `user_id: str = None` that can be taken from a query parameter, but the same *path operation* can be included in a router with a path `/users/{user_id}`, in which case will be taken from the path and will be required.
    * PR [#464](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/464) by [@jonathanunderwood](https://github.com/jonathanunderwood).

* Fix OpenAPI/JSON Schema generation for two functions with the same name (in different modules) with the same composite bodies.
    * Composite bodies' IDs are now based on path, not only on route name, as the auto-generated name uses the function names, that can be duplicated in different modules.
    * The same new ID generation applies to response models.
    * This also changes the generated title for those models.
    * Only composite bodies and response models are affected because those are generated dynamically, they don't have a module (a Python file).
    * This also adds the possibility of using `.include_router()` with the same `APIRouter` *multiple*  times, with different prefixes, e.g. `/api/v2` and `/api/latest`, and it will now work correctly.
    * PR [#347](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/347).

## 0.30.0

* Add support for Pydantic's ORM mode:
    * Updated documentation about SQL with SQLAlchemy, using Pydantic models with ORM mode, SQLAlchemy models with relations, separation of files, simplification of code and other changes. New docs: [SQL (Relational) Databases](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/).
    * The new support for ORM mode fixes issues/adds features related to ORMs with lazy-loading, hybrid properties, dynamic/getters (using `@property` decorators) and several other use cases.
    * This applies to ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM, GINO ORM and virtually any other.
    * If your *path operations* return an arbitrary object with attributes (e.g. `my_item.name` instead of `my_item["name"]`) AND you use a `response_model`, make sure to update the Pydantic models with `orm_mode = True` as described in the docs (link above).
    * New documentation about receiving plain `dict`s as request bodies: [Bodies of arbitrary `dict`s](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body-nested-models/#bodies-of-arbitrary-dicts).
    * New documentation about returning arbitrary `dict`s in responses: [Response with arbitrary `dict`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/extra-models/#response-with-arbitrary-dict).
    * **Technical Details**:
        * When declaring a `response_model` it is used directly to generate the response content, from whatever was returned from the *path operation function*.
        * Before this, the return content was first passed through `jsonable_encoder` to ensure it was a "jsonable" object, like a `dict`, instead of an arbitrary object with attributes (like an ORM model). That's why you should make sure to update your Pydantic models for objects with attributes to use `orm_mode = True`.
        * If you don't have a `response_model`, the return object will still be passed through `jsonable_encoder` first.
        * When a `response_model` is declared, the same `response_model` type declaration won't be used as is, it will be "cloned" to create an new one (a cloned Pydantic `Field` with all the submodels cloned as well).
        * This avoids/fixes a potential security issue: as the returned object is passed directly to Pydantic, if the returned object was a subclass of the `response_model` (e.g. you return a `UserInDB` that inherits from `User` but contains extra fields, like `hashed_password`, and `User` is used in the `response_model`), it would still pass the validation (because `UserInDB` is a subclass of `User`) and the object would be returned as-is, including the `hashed_password`. To fix this, the declared `response_model` is cloned, if it is a Pydantic model class (or contains Pydantic model classes in it, e.g. in a `List[Item]`), the Pydantic model class(es) will be a different one (the "cloned" one). So, an object that is a subclass won't simply pass the validation and returned as-is, because it is no longer a sub-class of the cloned `response_model`. Instead, a new Pydantic model object will be created with the contents of the returned object. So, it will be a new object (made with the data from the returned one), and will be filtered by the cloned `response_model`, containing only the declared fields as normally.

    * This allows declaring:
        * [Response Cookies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-cookies/).
        * [Response Headers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-headers/).
        * An HTTP Status Code different than the default: [Response - Change Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-change-status-code/).

    * PR [#294](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/294).

## 0.28.0

* Implement dependency cache per request.
    * This avoids calling each dependency multiple times for the same request.
    * This is useful while calling external services, performing costly computation, etc.
    * This also means that if a dependency was declared as a *path operation decorator* dependency, possibly at the router level (with `.include_router()`) and then it is declared again in a specific *path operation*, the dependency will be called only once.
    * The cache can be disabled per dependency declaration, using `use_cache=False` as in `Depends(your_dependency, use_cache=False)`.
    * Updated docs at: [Using the same dependency multiple times](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/sub-dependencies/#using-the-same-dependency-multiple-times).
    * PR [#292](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/292).

## 0.23.0

* Upgrade the compatible version of Starlette to `0.12.0`.
    * This includes support for ASGI 3 (the latest version of the standard).
    * It's now possible to use [Starlette's `StreamingResponse`](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#streamingresponse) with iterators, like [file-like](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object) objects (as those returned by `open()`).
    * It's now possible to use the low level utility `iterate_in_threadpool` from `starlette.concurrency` (for advanced scenarios).
    * PR [#243](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/243).

* Add OAuth2 redirect page for Swagger UI. This allows having delegated authentication in the Swagger UI docs. For this to work, you need to add `{your_origin}/docs/oauth2-redirect` to the allowed callbacks in your OAuth2 provider (in Auth0, Facebook, Google, etc).
    * For example, during development, it could be `http://localhost:8000/docs/oauth2-redirect`.
    * Keep in mind that this callback URL is independent of whichever one is used by your frontend. You might also have another callback at `https://yourdomain.com/login/callback`.
    * This is only to allow delegated authentication in the API docs with Swagger UI.

## 0.22.0

* Add support for `dependencies` parameter:
    * A parameter in *path operation decorators*, for dependencies that should be executed but the return value is not important or not used in the *path operation function*.
    * A parameter in the `.include_router()` method of FastAPI applications and routers, to include dependencies that should be executed in each *path operation* in a router.
        * This is useful, for example, to require authentication or permissions in specific group of *path operations*.
        * Different `dependencies` can be applied to different routers.
    * These `dependencies` are run before the normal parameter dependencies. And normal dependencies are run too. They can be combined.
    * Dependencies declared in a router are executed first, then the ones defined in *path operation decorators*, and then the ones declared in normal parameters. They are all combined and executed.
    * All this also supports using `Security` with `scopes` in those `dependencies` parameters, for more advanced OAuth 2.0 security scenarios with scopes.
    * New documentation about [dependencies in *path operation decorators*](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).
    * New documentation about [dependencies in the `include_router()` method](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-an-apirouter-with-a-prefix-tags-responses-and-dependencies).
    * PR [#235](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/235).

* Fix OpenAPI documentation of Starlette URL convertors. Specially useful when using `path` convertors, to take a whole path as a parameter, like `/some/url/{p:path}`. PR [#234](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/234) by [@euri10](https://github.com/euri10).

* Make default parameter utilities exported from `fastapi` be functions instead of classes (the new functions return instances of those classes). To be able to override the return types and fix `mypy` errors in FastAPI's users' code. Applies to `Path`, `Query`, `Header`, `Cookie`, `Body`, `Form`, `File`, `Depends`, and `Security`.

# Virtual Environments

When you work in Python projects you probably should use a **virtual environment** (or a similar mechanism) to isolate the packages you install for each project.

/// info

If you already know about virtual environments, how to create them and use them, you might want to skip this section. 🤓

///

/// tip

A **virtual environment** is different than an **environment variable**.

An **environment variable** is a variable in the system that can be used by programs.

A **virtual environment** is a directory with some files in it.

///

/// info

This page will teach you how to use **virtual environments** and how they work.

If you are ready to adopt a **tool that manages everything** for you (including installing Python), try <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">uv</a>.

///

## Create a Project

First, create a directory for your project.

What I normally do is that I create a directory named `code` inside my home/user directory.

And inside of that I create one directory per project.

<div class="termy">

```console
// Go to the home directory
$ cd
// Create a directory for all your code projects
$ mkdir code
// Enter into that code directory
$ cd code
// Create a directory for this project
$ mkdir awesome-project
// Enter into that project directory
$ cd awesome-project
```

</div>

## Create a Virtual Environment

When you start working on a Python project **for the first time**, create a virtual environment **<abbr title="there are other options, this is a simple guideline">inside your project</abbr>**.

/// tip

You only need to do this **once per project**, not every time you work.

///

//// tab | `venv`

To create a virtual environment, you can use the `venv` module that comes with Python.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python -m venv .venv
```

</div>

/// details | What that command means

* `python`: use the program called `python`
* `-m`: call a module as a script, we'll tell it which module next
* `venv`: use the module called `venv` that normally comes installed with Python
* `.venv`: create the virtual environment in the new directory `.venv`

///

////

//// tab | `uv`

If you have <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uv`</a> installed, you can use it to create a virtual environment.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ uv venv
```

</div>

/// tip

By default, `uv` will create a virtual environment in a directory called `.venv`.

But you could customize it passing an additional argument with the directory name.

///

////

That command creates a new virtual environment in a directory called `.venv`.

/// details | `.venv` or other name

You could create the virtual environment in a different directory, but there's a convention of calling it `.venv`.

///

## Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the new virtual environment so that any Python command you run or package you install uses it.

/// tip

Do this **every time** you start a **new terminal session** to work on the project.

///

//// tab | Linux, macOS

<div class="termy">

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
$ .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows Bash

Or if you use Bash for Windows (e.g. <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Git Bash</a>):

<div class="termy">

```console
$ source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

</div>

////

/// tip

Every time you install a **new package** in that environment, **activate** the environment again.

This makes sure that if you use a **terminal (<abbr title="command line interface">CLI</abbr>) program** installed by that package, you use the one from your virtual environment and not any other that could be installed globally, probably with a different version than what you need.

///

## Check the Virtual Environment is Active

Check that the virtual environment is active (the previous command worked).

/// tip

This is **optional**, but it's a good way to **check** that everything is working as expected and you are using the virtual environment you intended.

///

//// tab | Linux, macOS, Windows Bash

<div class="termy">

```console
$ which python

/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin/python
```

</div>

If it shows the `python` binary at `.venv/bin/python`, inside of your project (in this case `awesome-project`), then it worked. 🎉

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
$ Get-Command python

C:\Users\user\code\awesome-project\.venv\Scripts\python
```

</div>

If it shows the `python` binary at `.venv\Scripts\python`, inside of your project (in this case `awesome-project`), then it worked. 🎉

////

## Upgrade `pip`

/// tip

If you use <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uv`</a> you would use it to install things instead of `pip`, so you don't need to upgrade `pip`. 😎

///

If you are using `pip` to install packages (it comes by default with Python), you should **upgrade** it to the latest version.

Many exotic errors while installing a package are solved by just upgrading `pip` first.

/// tip

You would normally do this **once**, right after you create the virtual environment.

///

Make sure the virtual environment is active (with the command above) and then run:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

---> 100%
```

</div>

## Add `.gitignore`

If you are using **Git** (you should), add a `.gitignore` file to exclude everything in your `.venv` from Git.

/// tip

If you used <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uv`</a> to create the virtual environment, it already did this for you, you can skip this step. 😎

///

/// tip

Do this **once**, right after you create the virtual environment.

///

<div class="termy">

```console
$ echo "*" > .venv/.gitignore
```

</div>

/// details | What that command means

* `echo "*"`: will "print" the text `*` in the terminal (the next part changes that a bit)
* `>`: anything printed to the terminal by the command to the left of `>` should not be printed but instead written to the file that goes to the right of `>`
* `.gitignore`: the name of the file where the text should be written

And `*` for Git means "everything". So, it will ignore everything in the `.venv` directory.

That command will create a file `.gitignore` with the content:

```gitignore
*
```

///

## Install Packages

After activating the environment, you can install packages in it.

/// tip

Do this **once** when installing or upgrading the packages your project needs.

If you need to upgrade a version or add a new package you would **do this again**.

///

### Install Packages Directly

If you're in a hurry and don't want to use a file to declare your project's package requirements, you can install them directly.

/// tip

It's a (very) good idea to put the packages and versions your program needs in a file (for example `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).

///

//// tab | `pip`

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "fastapi[standard]"

---> 100%
```

</div>

////

//// tab | `uv`

If you have <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uv`</a>:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ uv pip install "fastapi[standard]"
---> 100%
```

</div>

////

### Install from `requirements.txt`

If you have a `requirements.txt`, you can now use it to install its packages.

//// tab | `pip`

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
---> 100%
```

</div>

////

//// tab | `uv`

If you have <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">`uv`</a>:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
---> 100%
```

</div>

////

/// details | `requirements.txt`

A `requirements.txt` with some packages could look like:

```requirements.txt
fastapi[standard]==0.113.0
pydantic==2.8.0
```

///

## Run Your Program

After you activated the virtual environment, you can run your program, and it will use the Python inside of your virtual environment with the packages you installed there.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python main.py

Hello World
```

</div>

## Configure Your Editor

You would probably use an editor, make sure you configure it to use the same virtual environment you created (it will probably autodetect it) so that you can get autocompletion and inline errors.

For example:

* <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_select-and-activate-an-environment" class="external-link" target="_blank">VS Code</a>
* <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html" class="external-link" target="_blank">PyCharm</a>

/// tip

You normally have to do this only **once**, when you create the virtual environment.

///

## Deactivate the Virtual Environment

Once you are done working on your project you can **deactivate** the virtual environment.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ deactivate
```

</div>

This way, when you run `python` it won't try to run it from that virtual environment with the packages installed there.

## Ready to Work

Now you're ready to start working on your project.



/// tip

Do you want to understand what's all that above?

///

## Why Virtual Environments

To work with FastAPI you need to install <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Python</a>.

After that, you would need to **install** FastAPI and any other **packages** you want to use.

To install packages you would normally use the `pip` command that comes with Python (or similar alternatives).

Nevertheless, if you just use `pip` directly, the packages would be installed in your **global Python environment** (the global installation of Python).

### The Problem

So, what's the problem with installing packages in the global Python environment?

At some point, you will probably end up writing many different programs that depend on **different packages**. And some of these projects you work on will depend on **different versions** of the same package. 😱

For example, you could create a project called `philosophers-stone`, this program depends on another package called **`harry`, using the version `1`**. So, you need to install `harry`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    stone(philosophers-stone) -->|requires| harry-1[harry v1]
```

Then, at some point later, you create another project called `prisoner-of-azkaban`, and this project also depends on `harry`, but this project needs **`harry` version `3`**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    azkaban(prisoner-of-azkaban) --> |requires| harry-3[harry v3]
```

But now the problem is, if you install the packages globally (in the global environment) instead of in a local **virtual environment**, you will have to choose which version of `harry` to install.

If you want to run `philosophers-stone` you will need to first install `harry` version `1`, for example with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "harry==1"
```

</div>

And then you would end up with `harry` version `1` installed in your global Python environment.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph global[global env]
        harry-1[harry v1]
    end
    subgraph stone-project[philosophers-stone project]
        stone(philosophers-stone) -->|requires| harry-1
    end
```

But then if you want to run `prisoner-of-azkaban`, you will need to uninstall `harry` version `1` and install `harry` version `3` (or just installing version `3` would automatically uninstall version `1`).

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "harry==3"
```

</div>

And then you would end up with `harry` version `3` installed in your global Python environment.

And if you try to run `philosophers-stone` again, there's a chance it would **not work** because it needs `harry` version `1`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph global[global env]
        harry-1[<strike>harry v1</strike>]
        style harry-1 fill:#ccc,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
        harry-3[harry v3]
    end
    subgraph stone-project[philosophers-stone project]
        stone(philosophers-stone) -.-x|⛔️| harry-1
    end
    subgraph azkaban-project[prisoner-of-azkaban project]
        azkaban(prisoner-of-azkaban) --> |requires| harry-3
    end
```

/// tip

It's very common in Python packages to try the best to **avoid breaking changes** in **new versions**, but it's better to be safe, and install newer versions intentionally and when you can run the tests to check everything is working correctly.

///

Now, imagine that with **many** other **packages** that all your **projects depend on**. That's very difficult to manage. And you would probably end up running some projects with some **incompatible versions** of the packages, and not knowing why something isn't working.

Also, depending on your operating system (e.g. Linux, Windows, macOS), it could have come with Python already installed. And in that case it probably had some packages pre-installed with some specific versions **needed by your system**. If you install packages in the global Python environment, you could end up **breaking** some of the programs that came with your operating system.

## Where are Packages Installed

When you install Python, it creates some directories with some files in your computer.

Some of these directories are the ones in charge of having all the packages you install.

When you run:

<div class="termy">

```console
// Don't run this now, it's just an example 🤓
$ pip install "fastapi[standard]"
---> 100%
```

</div>

That will download a compressed file with the FastAPI code, normally from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/fastapi/" class="external-link" target="_blank">PyPI</a>.

It will also **download** files for other packages that FastAPI depends on.

Then it will **extract** all those files and put them in a directory in your computer.

By default, it will put those files downloaded and extracted in the directory that comes with your Python installation, that's the **global environment**.

## What are Virtual Environments

The solution to the problems of having all the packages in the global environment is to use a **virtual environment for each project** you work on.

A virtual environment is a **directory**, very similar to the global one, where you can install the packages for a project.

This way, each project will have its own virtual environment (`.venv` directory) with its own packages.

## What Does Activating a Virtual Environment Mean

When you activate a virtual environment, for example with:

//// tab | Linux, macOS

<div class="termy">

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
$ .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows Bash

Or if you use Bash for Windows (e.g. <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Git Bash</a>):

<div class="termy">

```console
$ source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

</div>

////

That command will create or modify some [environment variables](environment-variables.md){.internal-link target=_blank} that will be available for the next commands.

One of those variables is the `PATH` variable.

/// tip

You can learn more about the `PATH` environment variable in the [Environment Variables](environment-variables.md#path-environment-variable){.internal-link target=_blank} section.

///

Activating a virtual environment adds its path `.venv/bin` (on Linux and macOS) or `.venv\Scripts` (on Windows) to the `PATH` environment variable.

Let's say that before activating the environment, the `PATH` variable looked like this:

//// tab | Linux, macOS

```plaintext
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

That means that the system would look for programs in:

* `/usr/bin`
* `/bin`
* `/usr/sbin`
* `/sbin`

////

//// tab | Windows

```plaintext
C:\Windows\System32
```

That means that the system would look for programs in:

* `C:\Windows\System32`

////

After activating the virtual environment, the `PATH` variable would look something like this:

//// tab | Linux, macOS

```plaintext
/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

That means that the system will now start looking first for programs in:

```plaintext
/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin
```

before looking in the other directories.

So, when you type `python` in the terminal, the system will find the Python program in

```plaintext
/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin/python
```

and use that one.

////

//// tab | Windows

```plaintext
C:\Users\user\code\awesome-project\.venv\Scripts;C:\Windows\System32
```

That means that the system will now start looking first for programs in:

```plaintext
C:\Users\user\code\awesome-project\.venv\Scripts
```

before looking in the other directories.

So, when you type `python` in the terminal, the system will find the Python program in

```plaintext
C:\Users\user\code\awesome-project\.venv\Scripts\python
```

and use that one.

////

An important detail is that it will put the virtual environment path at the **beginning** of the `PATH` variable. The system will find it **before** finding any other Python available. This way, when you run `python`, it will use the Python **from the virtual environment** instead of any other `python` (for example, a `python` from a global environment).

Activating a virtual environment also changes a couple of other things, but this is one of the most important things it does.

## Checking a Virtual Environment

When you check if a virtual environment is active, for example with:

//// tab | Linux, macOS, Windows Bash

<div class="termy">

```console
$ which python

/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin/python
```

</div>

////

//// tab | Windows PowerShell

<div class="termy">

```console
$ Get-Command python

C:\Users\user\code\awesome-project\.venv\Scripts\python
```

</div>

////

That means that the `python` program that will be used is the one **in the virtual environment**.

You use `which` in Linux and macOS and `Get-Command` in Windows PowerShell.

The way that command works is that it will go and check in the `PATH` environment variable, going through **each path in order**, looking for the program called `python`. Once it finds it, it will **show you the path** to that program.

The most important part is that when you call `python`, that is the exact "`python`" that will be executed.

So, you can confirm if you are in the correct virtual environment.

/// tip

It's easy to activate one virtual environment, get one Python, and then **go to another project**.

And the second project **wouldn't work** because you are using the **incorrect Python**, from a virtual environment for another project.

It's useful being able to check what `python` is being used. 🤓

///

## Why Deactivate a Virtual Environment

For example, you could be working on a project `philosophers-stone`, **activate that virtual environment**, install packages and work with that environment.

And then you want to work on **another project** `prisoner-of-azkaban`.

You go to that project:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ cd ~/code/prisoner-of-azkaban
```

</div>

If you don't deactivate the virtual environment for `philosophers-stone`, when you run `python` in the terminal, it will try to use the Python from `philosophers-stone`.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ cd ~/code/prisoner-of-azkaban

$ python main.py

// Error importing sirius, it's not installed 😱
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "main.py", line 1, in <module>
        import sirius
```

</div>

But if you deactivate the virtual environment and activate the new one for `prisoner-of-askaban` then when you run `python` it will use the Python from the virtual environment in `prisoner-of-azkaban`.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ cd ~/code/prisoner-of-azkaban

// You don't need to be in the old directory to deactivate, you can do it wherever you are, even after going to the other project 😎
$ deactivate

// Activate the virtual environment in prisoner-of-azkaban/.venv 🚀
$ source .venv/bin/activate

// Now when you run python, it will find the package sirius installed in this virtual environment ✨
$ python main.py

I solemnly swear 🐺
```

</div>

## Alternatives

This is a simple guide to get you started and teach you how everything works **underneath**.

There are many **alternatives** to managing virtual environments, package dependencies (requirements), projects.

Once you are ready and want to use a tool to **manage the entire project**, packages dependencies, virtual environments, etc. I would suggest you try <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" class="external-link" target="_blank">uv</a>.

`uv` can do a lot of things, it can:

* **Install Python** for you, including different versions
* Manage the **virtual environment** for your projects
* Install **packages**
* Manage package **dependencies and versions** for your project
* Make sure you have an **exact** set of packages and versions to install, including their dependencies, so that you can be sure that you can run your project in production exactly the same as in your computer while developing, this is called **locking**
* And many other things

## Conclusion

If you read and understood all this, now **you know much more** about virtual environments than many developers out there. 🤓

Knowing these details will most probably be useful in a future time when you are debugging something that seems complex, but you will know **how it all works underneath**. 😎
