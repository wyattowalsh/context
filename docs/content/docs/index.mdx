<span className="context-text"><b>context</b></span> is an [MIT-licensed open-source software project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wyattowalsh/context/refs/heads/main/LICENSE) for ***transforming web data, files, and GitHub sources into LLM-ready prompt context knowledge files for enhanced AI chats or agentic workflows via a **CLI**, **REST API**, or [**MCP Server**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).*** Additional prompt context well-structured-for-LLM-ingestion, authoritative, informative, and up-to-date increases LLM performance, enables in-context, post-training knowledge updates, and lower hallucinations. Million+ token context windows and the promise of many-shot prompting are a few SOTA developments that even further encourage the inclusion of good prompt contexts. <span className="context-text"><b>context</b></span> depends on [Crawl4AI](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) for web data processing, [Docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling) for file conversion, and [Gitingest](https://github.com/cyclotruc/gitingest) for GitHub data processing. [Typer](https://github.com/fastapi/typer) powers the CLI, [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) is the REST API framework, [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) for the MCP server, and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for python project management. See [here for the full enumeration of the project's technology stack](/docs/stack)  and [here for more technical details on the project.](/docs/details).
